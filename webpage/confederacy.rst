5. Using Prices to Infer Expectations


First Some Caveats
------------------

* Many books written on Confederate finance

     * None apply

     .. math::

            B_{t}  =  B_{t-1} + r B_{t-1} + G_t - T_t  - \frac{M_t - M_{t-1}}{P_t}

* Eight Treasury reports

    * war ends in April 1865

    * last report ends October 1864

* Still need to construct consistent time series for debt, interest payments, seignorage ...

The Confederate Constitution
----------------------------

Confederate States of America (CSA) used the United States Constitution as a template for their own.

     * more limits on the power of the central government.

     * for example, the United States Constitution states:

.. epigraph::

     The Congress shall have Power

.. epigraph::

      To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and 
      to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and 
      general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts 
      and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.

The Confederate Constitution takes out the general welfare clause.

     * The same clause in the Confederate Constitution reads:

.. epigraph::

      The Congress shall have Power

.. epigraph::

      To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, for revenue necessary to pay the Debts, provide for the common Defence;
      and carry on the government of the Confederate States; but no bounties shall be granted from the treasury, nor shall any duties,
      or taxes, or importation from foreign nations be laid to promote or foster any branch of industry; and all Duties, Imposts and 
      Excises shall be uniform throughout the Confederate States.

Asymmetric War
--------------

* If Confederacy wins -- only needs Union to quit

    * Confederacy survive, debt likely **will be** paid

    * Union will survive

* If Union Wins

    * Confederacy fails, debt most likely **won't be** paid

    * Union will survive

* Recall

.. math::

     B_{t} + \frac{M_t}{P_t} = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{j}(T_{t+j} -G_{t+j})

Confederate Expenditures
------------------------

* Almost all spending related to the war

* Reports combine coupon and principal payments into "payments on the debt"

      * later in war, lots of old debt paid off with new debt

* CAUTION: amounts are nominal, periods are not of equal length

     **Confederate Expenditures**

In millions of nominal Confederate dollars.

Confederate Revenue
-------------------

* Initially CSA expected short, inexpensive war

* On May 10, 1861 Secretary of the Confederate Treasury, Christopher Memminger, recommends a Gallatin-policy

     * finance war with borrowing

     * property taxes to cover the interest

            * slave holders had most to gain from war

            * State collection mechanisms already in place
   
     * Almost no revenue came in from this

            * states refused to participate

* Little in customs revenue and export duties

     * Union blockade

     * cotton embargo

* Internal taxes

     * income tax, sales taxes, profit taxes

     * sequestration

         * confiscation of land and goods owned by Northerners

* Little revenue

     * Union troops occupied territories

     * tax collectors poorly paid, easily evaded

    **Confederate Deficits**

In millions of nominal Confederate dollars.

Confederate Borrowing
---------------------

* Southern borrowers were not suppose to repay Northern lenders

      * many continued to repay.  Why?

* Issued both bonds and currency

     * placed loans both domestically and with Europe

     * South mostly agricultural, supply of loans tied to farming cycle

* Currency finance

     * payable in species after the peace

     * rapid inflation

     * inflation moved with battlefield success

What determines the price level?
--------------------------------

* Quantity theory of money?

.. math::

   Money \times Velocity &=& Price \times Output \\
   M     \times  V       &=& P     \times   Y    

* Expected discounted present value of future surpluses?

.. math::

     B_{t} + \frac{M_t}{P_t} =   \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{j}(T_{t+j} -G_{t+j})

End of War
----------

* Others estimate Confederate revenues were

     * 5\% from taxes (20\% for the Union)

     * 60\% seignorage

     * 30\% bond sales

     * 5\% other sources

* What is the optimal share from taxes?

* Confederacy ended the war with

     * \$712 million in long-term interest-bearing debt

     * \$1,554 million in short-term and non-interest bering debt

* Any hopes of Union assumption of these debts?
