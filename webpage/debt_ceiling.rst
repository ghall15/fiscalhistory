*********************************
The Debt Ceiling
*********************************

* Debt Limit evolved from the funding of the Panama Canal and World War I.

* Congress sets :math:`G_t`, :math:`TR_t` and :math:`T_t`, but also says :math:`B_t` must be less than some number.

* No big deal up until recently.

* Congress passes legislation on spending and taxes,
but then many can be reluctant to authorize the debt limit increase
implied by their own spending and tax choices.

* If not passed either would have to not pay part of :math:`INT`, :math:`G`, or :math:`TR`.

* True even if :math:`T > INT`.
