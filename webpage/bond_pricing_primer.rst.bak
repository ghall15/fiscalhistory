A Primer on Bond Pricing
*************************

What's a Bond?
==============

A bond is an I.O.U.  It is a piece of paper that states

     *on date* :math:`t`, *I will pay you* :math:`y` *dollars.*


Of course things can be a little more complicated than this.

Non-Coupon and Coupon Bonds
---------------------------

1. *Non-coupon* or *pure discount* bonds state

    on (just one) date :math:`t`, I will pay you :math:`P` dollars.

2. *Coupon* bonds promise a stream of payments.

      +---------------+-----------------+
      |  On date      | I will pay you  | 
      +===============+=================+
      | :math:`t_1`   |  :math:`c`      |     
      +---------------+-----------------+
      | :math:`t_2`   |  :math:`c`      |
      +---------------+-----------------+
      |:math:`\vdots` |  :math:`\vdots` |
      +---------------+-----------------+
      | :math:`T`     |  :math:`c+P`    |
      +---------------+-----------------+


:math:`c` stands for *coupon*.

:math:`P` stands for *principal* or *par value* or *face value* of the bond.

Present Value
-------------

Is a dollar today and dollar one year (365 days) from now worth the same amount
today?

* Time preference

* Could take a dollar today, invest it at an interest rate :math:`r` and have :math:`$1 \times (1+r)` in a year.

* In other words

.. math::
     \mbox{present value}  = \frac{\mbox{future value}}{1+r}

* In this equation :math:`r` is often referred to as the *discount rate*.

* If the discount rate is 6 percent, what is a dollar one year from now worth today?

.. math:: 
    \mbox{present value}  &=& \frac{\$1}{1+.06}  \\
                      &=&  \$0.943

* What is a dollar two years from now worth today?

.. math::

    \mbox{present value}  &=& \frac{1}{1+.06} \times \frac{\$1}{1+.06}  \\
                      &=&  \frac{1}{1+.06} \times \$0.943 \\
                      &=&  \$0.890 

Relationship between bond prices and yields for zero-coupon bonds
==================================================================

* Real, not nominal, variables

.. math::
    q_{t,t+j} &=& \mbox{real price of one unit of time $t+j$ consumption}\\
          &&  \mbox{at time t}\\
    r_{t,t+j} &=& \mbox{yield of a $j$-period $t+j$ pure discount}\\
           && \mbox{(zero coupon) bond at time t} \\
    q_{t,t+j} &=& \exp(-j r_{t,t+j}) \approx \frac{1}{(1+r_{t,t+j})^j} 

* Take logs of both sides

.. math::
    \log q_{t,t+j} &=& -j r_{t,t+j} \\
    r_{t,t+j} &=& - \frac{\log q_{t,t+j}}{j}

A Handy Math Fact
-----------------

.. math::
    \log (1+ r_{t,t+j}) \approx r_{t,t+j} \mbox{for ``small''} r_{t,t+j}'s

* Why?  Taylor Series (Newton)

.. math::
     f(x) &=& \log(1+x)\\
          &\approx& f(x_0) + (x-x_0)f'(x_0) |_{x=x_0}


* Apply with :math:`f(x) = \log(1+x)` and :math:`x_0 = 0`, then

.. math::
    \log(1+x) &\approx& 0 + x\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right) |_{x=x_0} \\
          &\approx& x


Happy Meal Theorem of Bond Pricing
----------------------------------

* Happy meal: burger, fries, drink, toy

* Consider a bond that at time :math:`t` promises to pay

      +---------+-----------+----------+---------+---------+---------+
      |  t      |    t+1    |   t+2    |   t+3   | ...     |  t+T    |
      +=========+===========+==========+=========+=========+=========+
      |   0     |     c     |    c     |    c    |  ...    |  P+c    |
      +---------+-----------+----------+---------+---------+---------+

* The value of the bond at time :math:`t` is then

.. math::
    V_t &=& c q_{t,t+1} + c q_{t,t+2} +  ... + c q_{t,t+T} + P q_{t,t+T} \\
        &=& c (q_{t,t+1} + q_{t,t+2} +  ... + q_{t,t+T}) + P q_{t,t+T}

* The value of this same bond at :math:`t+1`, after :math:`c` has been paid, is

.. math::
    V_{t+1}  = c (q_{t+1,t+2} + q_{t+1,t+3} +  ... + q_{t+1,t+T}) + P q_{t+1,t+T}

* Evidently

.. math::
    V_t = q_{t,t+1} \left( c + V_{t+1} \right)

Forward Rates
==============

* With no uncertainty, the law of one price asserts that

.. math::
    q_{t,t+j} = q_{t,t+1} q_{t+1,t+j}


* Two ways at time :math:`t` to buy one unit of consumption at :math:`t+j`

     * either pay :math:`q_{t,t+j}` at time :math:`t`, or

     * pay :math:`q_{t,t+1}` at time :math:`t` and :math:`q_{t+1,t+j}` at time :math:`t+1`

* Define

.. math::
    \tilde{q}^t_{t+1,t+j} \equiv \frac{q_{t,t+j}}{q_{t,t+1}}

as the *forward price* at :math:`t`.

* With no uncertainty about future interest rates

.. math:: 
    \tilde{q}^t_{t+1,t+j} = q_{t+1,t+j}

* When there is uncertainty, these two won't necessarily be equal.

Yield to Maturity
-----------------

* The yield to maturity is the unique :math:`r` that satisfies

.. math::
    V = \frac{c}{1+r}  + \frac{c}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{c}{(1+r)^3} + ... + \frac{c+P}{(1+r)^T}


given :math:`V`, :math:`c`, :math:`P`, and :math:`T`.

* Usually can not be solved for by hand.

* It is sometimes just called the yield.

A Three Period Coupon Bond Example
----------------------------------

* Bond issued at :math:`t=0` and is a riskless claim on stream

      +--------+---------+---------+
      |   0    |   1     |    2    |
      +========+=========+=========+ 
      |   0    |   c     |   c+P   |
      +--------+---------+---------+

* Again, :math:`c` is the coupon and :math:`P` is the principal or par value

* The time :math:`t=0` price of the bond is

.. math::
    V_0 = q_{0,1} c + q_{0,2}(c+P)

* After payment of the coupon, the price of the bond at time :math:`t=1` is

.. math::
    V_1 = q_{1,2}(c+P)

Value of a Call Option
=======================

* At :math:`t=0`, you purchase the right to buy the bond at :math:`t=1` at a price :math:`P`.

    * thus, :math:`P` serves as both the *par value* and the *strike price*.

* The value of this option at time 1 is :math:`\max(0,V_1 - P)`.

* You will want to exercise the call option is

.. math::
    P <  V_1 = q_{1,2}(c+P)

* An interesting benchmark case: when is :math:`V_1 = P`?

Solve equation

.. math::
    V_1 = P = q_{1,2}(c+P)

for :math:`q_{1,2}`

That is:

.. math::
    q_{1,2} = \frac{P}{c+P}

or

.. math::
    1+r_{1,2} \approx \frac{c+P}{P}

* Question:  when is :math:`V_0 = V_1 = P`?

* Often see that Congress is reluctant to issue bonds selling at less than :math:`P`.

Extend the Example: Interest rate risk
--------------------------------------

* payouts known for certain

* uncertain future interest rates

* three time periods: :math:`0`, :math:`1`, and :math:`2`.

.. math::
    q_{0,1}, \; \; q_{1,2}(H), \; \; q_{1,2}(L) \; \; \mbox{ where $q_{1,2}(H) > q_{1,2}(L)$}

* Assume :math:`q_{1,2}(H)` occurs with probability :math:`\pi_0`.

* And :math:`q_{1,2}(L)` occurs with probability :math:`1-\pi_0`.

* Simple "expectations theory" of the term structure

.. math::
    q_{0,2} &=& q_{0,1}(\pi_0 q_{1,2}(H) + (1-\pi_0) q_{1,2}(L)) \\
    \frac{q_{0,2}}{q_{0,1}} &\equiv& \tilde{q}^0_{1,2} = \pi_0 q_{1,2}(H) + (1-\pi_0) q_{1,2}(L)

* :math:`\tilde{q}^0_{1,2}` is the *forward price*.

   - is an average of the two possible prices next period

   - no adjustment for risk

   - fancier theories adjust for risk

   - whose :math:`\pi_0`? (rational expectations)

* Similarly

.. math::
     \tilde{r}^0_{1,2} = \pi_0 r_{1,2}(L) + (1-\pi_0) r_{1,2}(H)

flip the :math:`H` and :math:`L` because high bond prices mean low interest rates

Value of a Call Option
----------------------

* At :math:`t=0`, you purchase the right to buy the bond at :math:`t=1` at a price :math:`P`.

* Assume that

.. math::
     q_{1,2}(H) > q_{1,2}(L)

and

.. math::
     q_{1,2}(H)(c+P) > P > q_{1,2}(L)(c+P)

* If state :math:`H` occurs the time :math:`1` value of the call is

.. math::
     V_1^{call} = \max(0,q_{1,2}(H)(c+P) -P) > 0

* If state :math:`L` occurs the time :math:`1` value of the call is

.. math::
     V_1^{call} = \max(0, q_{1,2}(L)(c+P) -P) = 0

* Therefore, the time :math:`0` value of the call is

.. math::
     V_0^{call} = q_{0,1} \left[ \pi_0(q_{1,2}(H)(c+P) -P) \right]

Example
-------

*  Example: With constant interest rates satisfying the "Congress wishful thinking condition"

.. math::
     P = q_{t,t+1}(c+P)

or

.. math::
     q_{t,t+1} = \frac{P}{c+P} \; \mbox{ for all $t$}

then the value of the call is zero.

* Hence

.. math::
     q_{1,2}(H) = q_{1,2}(L) = \frac{P}{P+c}

Pricing a Callable Bond
=======================

* Consider

.. math::
    q_{1,2}(H)  > \frac{P}{P+c} > q_{1,2}(L)

* Value of a non-callable bond

.. math::
    V_0 = q_{0,1} c + q_{0,2}(c+P)

* Suppose the government issues a two period bond that is callable in period 1 at par.

* A callable bond can be decomposed into two parts
   1. non-callable bond
   2. call option

* When the government issues a callable bond, it sells part 1 and buys part 2.

* Happy Meal Theorem:  Value of a callable bond

.. math::
    V_0 - V_0^{call}

Example: 20 Year Coupon Bond
----------------------------

* Suppose that this year (January 1, 2014) you purchase a 6\% percent 2034 U.S. Treasury bond with a face value of \$100.

+--------+----------+--------+---------+------+-------+------+
|  2014  |   2015   |  2016  |  2017   | ...  | 2033  | 2034 |
+--------+----------+--------+---------+------+-------+------+
|   0    |    6     |   6    |   6     |  ... | 6     | 106  |
+--------+----------+--------+---------+------+-------+------+

* No uncertainty

* Apply the Happy Meal Theorem

.. math::
    V_{2013} &=& q_{2013,2014} C + q_{2013,2015} C + q_{2013,2016} C + q_{2013,2033} ( C + P)

* Assume a constant interest rate

* a flat term structure

.. math::
     r_{2013,2014} = r_{2014,2015} = r_{2015,2016} = r_{2016,2017} ... = \bar{r}

* So :math:`\bar{r}` is the yield-to-maturity or YTM.

Use Excel to do the valuations
------------------------------

* Let EXCEL do the calculations for us

   - Set :math:`\bar{r}=.06`

   - Set :math:`\bar{r}=.03`

* Set :math:`\bar{r} =.09`

* If a bond's coupon rate is
    - less than its YTM, then the bond is selling at a *discount*.
    - more than its YTM, then the bond is selling at a *premium*.
    - equal to its YTM, then the bond is selling at *par*.

One Type of Risk:  Interest Rate Risk
-------------------------------------

* Suppose that the (constant) interest rate is 6 percent

* Five years from now, in 2019, (after we receive the 2019 coupon payment), there is
   - :math:`\pi` chance the interest rate will fall to 3\% from 2019 on
   - :math:`1-\pi` chance the interest rate will rise to 9\% from 2019 on

* How does this risk affect our bond pricing?

   - Assumption:  we are risk-neutral.

   - We need to price both possibilities.
 
* Work Backwards

* What is our 20 year, \$100 face value, 6\% coupon, bond worth in 2019?

   - CASE I:  Interest rate falls to 3 percent

.. math::
      V_{2019}^{.03} = \sum_{t=1}^{15}\frac{C}{(1+0.03)^t} + \frac{P}{(1+.03)^{15}}

   - CASE II: Interest rate rises to 9 percent

.. math;:
      V_{2019}^{.09} = \sum_{t=1}^{15}\frac{C}{(1+0.09)^t} + \frac{P}{(1+.09)^{15}}

* So what is our bond worth today in 2014?

.. math::
      V_{2014} =  \sum_{t=1}^{5}\frac{C}{(1+0.06)^t} + \pi \frac{V_{2019}^{.03}}{(1+.06)^5} + (1-\pi) \frac{V_{2019}^{.09}}{(1+.06)^5}

A Call Option
-------------

* Consider the following contract: Today (in 2014) I sell you the right to purchase this bond in year 2019 for $100.

   -You don't have to purchase the bond.  It is an option.

* How much is this option worth?

    - Again, work backwards.  In 2019, consider both cases

         1. CASE I:  $ \max(0, V_{2018}^{.03} - 100) $

         2. CASE II: $ \max(0, V_{2018}^{.09} - 100) $

* In 2019

.. math::
      V_{2019}^{call} = \pi \max(0, V_{2019}^{.03} - 100) + (1-\pi) \max(0, V_{2019}^{.09}- 100)

* In 2014

.. math::
      V_{2014}^{call}  = \frac{V_{2019}^{call}}{(1+.06)^5}

What's the price of a 5-20 bond?
--------------------------------

* Consider a 20 year coupon bond that callable at par by the Treasury after five years.

* Happy Meal Theorem

.. math::
     V_{2014} - V_{2014}^{call}

* If a callable bond always sells for less than a non-callable bond, why would a government ever issue a callable bond?

Using the G. B. C. to Price Government Debt
============================================

* The price of a bond is the discounted present value of the stream of promised
    payments

* We could think of the government budget constraint much the same way.  Recall we can rewrite the g.b.c. as:

.. math::
       B_{t}  =   \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{j}(T_{t+j} - G_{t+j})

* Last lecture, we assumed the future paths of :math:`T` and :math:`G` will have to adjust to satisfy the current value of :math:`B_t`.

* But what if the expected value of

   .. math::
       \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{j}(T_{t+j} - G_{t+j})

  is less than the face value of the current stock of debt?

   - If future :math:`T` s and :math:`G` s are constrained, bond prices will adjust.

* So is the government budget constraint a constraint?  Or is it a pricing formula?

Bond Returns
------------

* Suppose you buy a bond at period :math:`t` a price :math:`V_t`, hold it one period, and sell it at price :math:`V_{t+1}`.  What is your return?

* In period :math:`t+1` you receive the coupon payment and the sales price.

* So the one-period ex-post holding return for a bond is

.. math::
      1+r_{t,t+1} = \frac{C + V_{t+1}}{V_t}

Recorded Government Interest Payments
======================================

* What the Bureau of the Public Debt reports as its nominal interest payments
    - discount the bills
    - add up the coupons on notes and bonds

* Answers the question 

    *how many dollars must the Treasury devote to paying coupons on 
    this period's outstanding government bonds while rolling over 
    the nominal stock of treasury bills?*  

* Leaves out capital gains and losses on Treasury notes and bonds obligations.

* Does not answer the question  

    *what return did government bond holders receive?*

Comparison Between Official Interest Payments and Returns to Bondholders
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Means and Standard Deviations of Returns
-----------------------------------------

+------------------------------------+----------+----------+
| Variable                           |  Mean    | Std Dev  |
+------------------------------------+----------+----------+
| Official Interest/Debt             |   5.20   |    2.54  |
+------------------------------------+----------+----------+
| Inflation                          |   3.73   |    2.67  |
+------------------------------------+----------+----------+
| Official Interest/Debt - inflation |   1.47   |    3.31  |
+------------------------------------+----------+----------+
| Real Return on Marketable Debt     |   1.63   |    4.86  |
+------------------------------------+----------+----------+

Does this Accounting Issue Matter?
----------------------------------

* Reported interest payments on the debt are not the :math:`R_t B^G_{t}` in the government budget constraint.
     - Is this a big deal?

* The Treasury
    1. reports the par value rather than the market value of its debt, and
    2. typically sets the coupon rate so that at auction, bonds sell near par.

* In this case the ytm equals the coupon rate, and the par value and the market value will not be that different.

* Will get big differences between the par value and market value when there are large capital gains and losses (perhaps due to changes in inflation)

    - War of 1812

* Talk these days about using inflation to erode the debt. To frame the tradeoff, need to properly account for interest the government actually pays.
