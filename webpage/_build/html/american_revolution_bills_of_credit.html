<h2>How does one finance a revolution?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-one-finance-a-revolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the Continental Congress first met in Philadelphia in 1774 is was not clear whether the
goal was independence or to change Britain&#8217;s policies.  A political solution still seemed
possible.  However, as positions hardened, military events at Concord, Lexington, and Bunker Hill
moved a political solution further out of reach.</p>
<p>As with any government, Continental government faced the usual government budget constraint</p>
<div class="math">
\[B_{t}  =  (1+r)B_{t-1} + G_t - T_t  - \frac{M_t - M_{t-1}}{P_t}\]</div>
<p>Being a new government, the Continental government had the advantage of starting out debt free.
The initial value of debt <span class="math">\(B_{1774}\)</span> was zero.</p>
<p>However the Congress needed raise revenue to support an army.  Its options were</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>collect taxes</li>
<li>borrow</li>
<li>print money</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Almost immediately, the challenges to raising revenue became obvious. In 1775, it was still
uncertain whether that goal of the Continental Congress was to establish a new government.
For some, the Continetal Congress was a demonstration of the colonists unity and resolve, and
the threat of an armed conflict was a bargaining chip for negiotating a better arrangement vis-a-vi
the Britian.</p>
<blockquote>

the Congress&#8217; legitimacy.</li>

<h3>Digression &#8211;  A puzzling phrase<a class="headerlink" href="#digression-a-puzzling-phrase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We were puzzled by the Latin phrase <em>Exitus in Dubio Est</em> which appears
alongside a picture of an eagle and a heron or crane fighting in the sky
on the three dollar continental. The phrase means &#8220;The Outcome is in Doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our good friend, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/people/velde_francois.cfm">Francois Velde</a>, provided the following answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Other denominations bore similar pairings of Latin mottoes
and images; such pairings are called &#8220;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.heraldica.org/topics/imprese.htm">imprese</a>&#8221;, in which the picture is the body and the motto
(in Italian: &#8220;word&#8221;) is the soul, illuminating the moral or explaining the allegory:</p>
<p>The source seems to be <a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1PlDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA64">Johann Camerarius&#8217;s Symbola et Emblemata</a>, a work first printed in 1590:
although the figure of a crane and an eagle (or falcon) fighting appears in <a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FOZVPjSTznwC&amp;pg=PA62">paintings of Carpaccio and
Veneziano, and an engraving of Durer</a>:</p>
<p>The phrase itself appears twice in Ovid, in the Metamorphoses and in the Fasti.  In the latter case, it
is used by Tarquin as he hesitates to go back and rape Lucretia; he continues by saying that he will
go to any extremity, and that gods and fortune smile on the daring.</p>
<p>Camerarius explains that &#8220;the battles of Mars are dubious and uncertain events; he often loses who
was near victory&#8221;.  The story is that, although you might think the falcon would be the obvious winner,
the heron&#8217;s excrements could so soil the falcon&#8217;s plumage as to make him unable to fly, if only he could
remain on top.</p>
<p>All of the other figures on the continental issues are taken straight from Camerarius, so it seems clear that
this book was the source.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.historycarper.com/1775/09/20/account-of-the-devices-on-the-continental-bills-of-credit/">1775 article in the Pennsylvania Gazette</a> is attributed to Ben Franklin.
The idea of putting an allegory with a Latin motto on coinage or near-coinage is of course an old tradition.
It still lives in the US great seal, with the rising constellation of 13 stars and the motto &#8220;e pluribus unum&#8221;,
out of many one.</p>

<p>In 1775, what is a dollar?   It is silver Spanish coin, known as a Spanish milled dollar.</p>

<p>In this image, we show a Spanish milled dollar. In order to &#8220;make change&#8221; holders of these dollars
would cut them
into two, four and eight pieces.  The legacy of this practice lives on even to this day.  For example,</p>

<h3>A thought experiment: disintegrating money<a class="headerlink" href="#a-thought-experiment-disintegrating-money" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Suppose on December 31 of this year, a type of paper money will magicaly
disinitograte instanteously losing all value.  If this is known for certain by all,
will anyone want hold this money on December 31? Of course not. No one will
want to be the chump who is holding the money the moment it becomes worthless.</p>
<p>Step back one day.  Will anyone want to hold this money on December 30? The answer is no again.</p>
<p>Step back two days.  Will anyone want to hold this money on December 29?</p>
<p>We could keep going, and it becomes clear that do will want to hold this money even</p>
<p>But suppose we change the example to allow the government to accept this money for tax payments
on December 30.  Now would someone be willing to hold the money on December 30?  Yes.</p>
<p>We could extend the example further by having the government require that taxes be paid in this money.  If
the taxes to be paid are sufficently large and the supply of this disinitegrating money sufficently
small, this money could become quite valuable.</p>
<p>The point of this though experiment is to</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{M_{t}}{P_{t}} = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} (1+\pi)^{j} \left( T_{t+j} - G_{t+j} \right).\]</div>
<p>Thus fiat money can have value, if the goverment must credible commit to running sufficient large
future surpluses to buy back or</p>
<p>In words, this equation implies that people hold money with the expectation that sometime in the future
the government will run surpluses, and with these surpluses the government will &#8220;buy back&#8221; or equivalently
accept for tax payments the paper money it previously issued.  If people expect the government to run large
surpluses in the near future and buy back its fiat money at face value, fiat money will trade at (or near)
its face value.  Alternatively, if people expect the government to never run surpluses, the value of the
currency will fall and money could become worthless.  Consequently, we can use <span class="math">\(M/P\)</span> as a measure of
citizen real-time expectations of the right hand side of equation X.</p>
<p>Continental government requested that the states accept bills of credit for payment of taxes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>each colony given a quota</li>
<li>these bills of credit would then be returned to the Continental government to be burned.</li>
<li>riding on the good reputations of the colonies</li>

<p>To further encourage demand for Continental Dollars, the Contenental government tried both moral and
legal persuasion.</p>

accept these bills</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>That if any person shall hereafter be so

<p>Congress also recommended to states that the state legislatures pass laws making these bills of

<p>Money serves three purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>as a medium of exchange;</li>
<li>as a store of value; and</li>
<li>as an unit of account.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We can think of the quantity theory of money</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{M}{P} = k Y\]</div>
<p>as capturing the demand for money as a medium of exchange (i.e. it facilitates carrying out transactions).
The higher your income <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>, the more transactions you carry out, the more real balances you will
need to hold.</p>
<p>We can think of the expression you just derived as capturing the demand for money as a store of value.
We needed to assume that money delivers a positive rate of return or else no one would hold it. Clearly
people hold fiat money despite the fact that it generally delivers a negative rate of return because it
is valuable as a medium of exchange.  We could derive a more sophisticated theory of money demand which
embeds both of these motives so that people would demand money despite its negative rate of return; but
for this problem set, these two expressions serve our purpose.</p>
