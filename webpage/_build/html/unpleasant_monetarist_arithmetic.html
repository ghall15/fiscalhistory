<p>Recall that in the Government Budget Constraint lecture, we derived an expression
for real seignorage revenue.  In that lecture, we assumed real money demand was only
a function of real income and that real income
was constant.  But clearly, income is rarely constant, and the demand for money most likely depends
on other factors than just income.</p>
<p>In this lecture, we first want to present a richer theory of money demand.</p>
<p>Second, we will discuss how the quantity of revenue the government can collect from seignorage can increase
or decrease as the inflation rate rises.</p>
<p>Third, we will return to the government budget constraint to illustrate how if a fiscal
authority runs persistent deficits, then low inflation today can mean high inflation in the future.</p>

<h2>A More Complete Description of Money Demand<a class="headerlink" href="#a-more-complete-description-of-money-demand" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of money&#8217;s three primary functions is to serve as a store of value. Of course, there
are many other assets that can serve as a store of value as well: stocks, bonds, houses, ... It is natural
to assume that people will want spread their wealth across several types of assets rather than
hold all their wealth in a single asset.</p>
<p>Thus how much of a person&#8217;s wealth he or she will want to store in money will be part of
a larger portfolio allocation.</p>
<p>People generally care about three things when deciding how to
allocate their wealth among various assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the asset&#8217;s expected return</li>
<li>the riskiness of the asset&#8217;s return</li>
<li>the liquidity of the asset</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We will go through each of these factors individually.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-expected-return-on-money">
<h3>The expected return on money<a class="headerlink" href="#the-expected-return-on-money" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>What is the opportunity cost of holding money?  In other words,
suppose you decide, on average, to keep $100 in your wallet.  What
are you giving up?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>real return you would have received by holding  your
wealth in some other form.</li>
<li>devaluation of money in pocket due to inflation.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, one can simply think of the cost in nominal terms.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>If I keep $100 in my wallet, at the end of a year I have $100.</li>
<li>If I lend the $100 for one year, at the end of a year I have <span class="math">\(\$100 \times(1+R)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Cost (per dollar) of holding money equals <span class="math">\(R\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Makes sense since we know <span class="math">\(R \approx r + \pi\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="risk">
<h3>Risk<a class="headerlink" href="#risk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Risk is the degree of uncertainty in an asset&#8217;s return.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t like risk.</p>
<p>Currency is not a risk free asset. Currency crises make this point.</p>
<p>The rate of inflation, devaluations are all uncertain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="liquidity">
<h3>Liquidity<a class="headerlink" href="#liquidity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Liquidity is the ease and quickness with which an asset can be traded. People tend to like liquidity.</p>
<p>Some assets like houses are very illiquid; that is, they may be hard to
sell quickly.</p>
<p>Other assets such as stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange are very liquid; they
are easy to sell quickly.</p>
<p>It is hard to think of an asset that is more liquid than U.S. dollars.  In the U.S. every
cashier is willing to accept dollars in return for providing a good or service.</p>
<p>In summary,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>money has a low rate of return, can at time be very risky, but is very liquid.</em></div></blockquote>

<p>Finally we assume that an increase in the nominal return of non-monetary assets, <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, reduces money demand.</p>

<h2>The Inflation Tax<a class="headerlink" href="#the-inflation-tax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Recall that in the Government Budget Constraint lecture, we derived the following expression
for real seignorage revenue</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{M_{t} - M_{t-1}}{P_t}  = \frac{\mu}{1+\mu} \frac{M_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> was the money growth rate and <span class="math">\(\Phi\)</span> denoted the demand for real money balances.</p>
<p>Recall that under the quantity theory of money, the inflation rate, <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> will equal the money growth
rate, <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using our richer description of money demand</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{M_{t} - M_{t-1}}{P_t}  = \frac{\pi}{1+\pi} \Phi(Y,r+\pi)\]</div>
<p>We see that as the inflation rate increases</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the &#8220;tax rate&#8221; <span class="math">\(\frac{\pi}{1+\pi}\)</span> increases, but</li>
<li>the demand for real money balances <span class="math">\(\Phi(Y,r+\pi)\)</span> decreases.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So will an increase in the inflation rate cause seignorage revenue to increase or decrease?  Well, it
depends whether the tax rate increases more or less than the demand for real money balances decreases.</p>
<p>When we look at the data, we typically find that at low rates of inflation, seignorage revenue
is an increasing function of the inflation rate.  But as the inflation rate grows, the demand for
real money balances  falls dramatically as consumers and firms actively substitute other
assets (often other currencies) to use as a store of value.  Hence there is a maximum value of
seignorage revenue that a government can hope to raise.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Revenue from Seignorage as a Function of the Money Growth Rate</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In the above figure we plot seignorage revenue <span class="math">\(\frac{\mu}{1+\mu} \Phi(Y,r+\mu)\)</span>
as a function of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>.
This relationship with tax revenue and the tax rate is known as a <em>Laffer curve</em>.
When money growth rate is
zero, inflation is zero and the revenue generated from seignorage is zero.</p>
<p>If we increase the money growth rate, seignorage revenue increases but less than one-for-one.  As the
money growth rate, and thus
the inflation rate, increases, real money demand falls. As the rate of return on money decreases, people
wish to hold a smaller share of their wealth in money, shifting more of their wealth into other
assets such as stocks and foreign currencies.</p>
<p>If the money growth rate becomes sufficiently large, money demand falls faster than the increase in the
inflation rate.  On the right hand side of the Laffer curve, higher money growth rates generate
<em>less</em> not more seignorage revenue.  In the data, the inflection point is
often around an inflation rate of about 30 percent.</p>

<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>In normal times for most countries, the government obtains only a small portion of
its revenue from printing money.  In 2005, the Federal Reserve obtained $24 billion
from this source.  This amount constituted 1.1% of total federal receipts and 0.2%
of GDP.  These figures are typical for most developed countries</p>
<p>In a few high inflation countries, the reenue from printing money became more more
important.  For example, in Argentina from 1960 to 1975, money creation accounted
for nearly half of government revenue and about 6% of GDP.  Some other countries
in which revenue from printing money was important were Chile (5% of GDP from 1960

<h2>Budget Constraint Arithmetic<a class="headerlink" href="#budget-constraint-arithmetic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Consider a sequence of government budget constraint beginning at an initial date, time 1.</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}B_{1}  &amp;=&amp;  (1+r) B_{0} + G_1 - T_1 - \frac{M_1 - M_{0}}{P_1} \\
B_{2}  &amp;=&amp;  (1+r) B_{1} + G_2 - T_2 - \frac{M_2 - M_{1}}{P_2} \\
B_{3}  &amp;=&amp;  (1+r) B_{2} + G_3 - T_3 - \frac{M_3 - M_{2}}{P_3} \\
\vdots\end{split}\]</div>
<p>We can rewrite this third equation as:</p>
<div class="math">
\[B_2 = \frac{1}{1+r} \left( B_3 - G_3 + T_3 + \frac{M_3 - M_2}{P_3} \right).\]</div>
<p>Substituting this expression for <span class="math">\(B_2\)</span> into the second
equation yields:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{1}{1+r} \left( B_3 - G_3 + T_3 + \frac{M_3 - M_2}{P_3} \right) = (1+r) B_{1} + G_2 - T_2  - \frac{M_2 - M_{1}}{P_2}.\]</div>
<p>Re-arranging terms, we get</p>
<div class="math">
\[G_2 - T_2 + \frac{G_3 - T_3}{1+r} + (1+r)B_1 - \frac{B_3}{1+r} =  \frac{M_2 - M_{1}}{P_2} + \frac{1}{1+r} \frac{M_3 - M_{2}}{P_3}.\]</div>
<p>If we repeat this recursive substitution an infinite number of times, we get</p>
<div class="math">
\[\sum_{t=2}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{t-1} (G_t - T_t) + (1+r)B_1  = \sum_{t=2}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{t-1} \frac{M_t - M_{t-1}}{P_t}\]</div>
<p>This expression states that the discounted present value of the stream of government deficits
from period 2 onward plus the initial
value of the debt equals
the discounted present value of the stream of seignorage revenue.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s rewrite this as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\sum_{t=2}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{t-1} (G_t - T_t) + (1+r)B_1  = \sum_{t=2}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{t-1} \frac{\mu}{1+\mu} \Phi(Y,r+\mu).\]</div>
<p>Consider this the <em>long-run</em> budget constraint.</p>
<p>Then recall we still have the first period budget constraint</p>
<div class="math">
\[B_{1}  =  (1+r) B_{0} + G_1 - T_1   \frac{M_1 - M_{0}}{P_1}.\]</div>
<p>Consider this the <em>short-run</em> budget constraint.</p>
<p>Now suppose that the government keeps spending, taxes, debt and the money growth rate
fixed from period 2 on.  In equations, we state, for <span class="math">\(t \ge 2\)</span> set</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}G_t &amp;=&amp; G \\
T_t &amp;=&amp; T \\
B_t &amp;=&amp; B \\
\frac{M_t}{M_{t-1}} &amp;=&amp; 1+\mu.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In this case, we can write the long run budget constraint as;</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{G - T}{1 - \frac{1}{1+r}}  + (1+r)B  = \frac{\frac{\mu}{1+\mu} \Phi(Y,r+\mu)}{1 - \frac{1}{1+r}}.\]</div>
<p>We can simply this expression to</p>
<div class="math">
\[G - T + rB = \frac{\mu}{1+\mu}\Phi(Y,r+\mu).\]</div>
<p>This expression just states that each period the deficit must equal the seignorage revenue.</p>
<p>In the figure below we plot the left hand side and the right side of the equation for different values of
the money growth rate <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>.  Since the left hand side (i.e. the deficit) does not depend on
the money grwoth rate, it is a
horizontal line.  We plot it in red.  The right hand side is the seignorage revenue.  It does depend on
<span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>.  We plot it in blue.  It is the Lafer curve that we plotted in the previous figure.</p>
<p>There line cross twice. Once at a low money growth rate.  Once at a high money growth rate.  Focus on the
lower intersection. This intersection determines the money growth rate the monetary authority must run in
order to cover the fiscal deficits.</p>

<p>In this country, the quantity theory of money holds and velocity is constant.  Since output is

steady state values of government expenditures <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, tax collections <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, and
real value of government debt <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.
The gross real rate of return on interest-bearing government debt is <span class="math">\(1+r\)</span>.  Table 2
displays the monetary conditions in
terms of the public&#8217;s demand for real balances of government issued money <span class="math">\(\Phi(Y,r+\mu)\)</span>.
Here <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is
the stationary net growth rate of the nominal money supply, namely,</p>
<div class="math">
\[M_t = (1+\mu)M_{t-1},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(M_t\)</span> is the nominal money supply at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.</p>

<div>The unit of time is one year and all quantities are expressed as fraction of GDP per year.</div></blockquote>
