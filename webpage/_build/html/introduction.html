<p>Welcome to the Fiscal History of the United States webpage.</p>
<p>This website presents a series of lectures on the history of the United States
through decisions at the federal and state levels on taxes, spending,
and debts.  These lectures were designed and written by <a class="reference external" href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~ghall/">George J. Hall</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://files.nyu.edu/ts43/public/">Thomas J. Sargent</a>.</p>
<p>These lectures pay particular attention to debt crises,
the financing of wars and infrastructure, and the development of
public institutions.</p>
<p>These lectures will also discuss the political debates surrounding the choices made. In the process, we will present and evaluate
contemporary theories of monetary and fiscal policy.</p>
<div class="section" id="companion-texts">
<h2>Companion Texts<a class="headerlink" href="#companion-texts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The companion textbook for these lectures is Davis Dewey&#8217;s masterpiece <em>Financial History of the United States</em> published by Longmans, Green and Co. of New York.</p>
<p>Electronic version of the book are available for free from <a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Financial_History_of_the_United_States.html?id=l3oaAAAAMAAJ">google books</a>. If you prefer a hardcopy, reprints and some used copies are available from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.abebooks.com">Abe Books</a> as well as other on-line booksellers. If possible try to get the 12th edition published in 1934, but earlier editions are fine.</p>
<p>Dewey&#8217;s text is &#8220;old school&#8221; (and old), but it is thorough with respect to U.S. financial and fiscal history. It is content rich &#8211; it is worth reading slowly.</p>
<p>If you have never taken a high school or college course in U.S. history, you will find it helpful to have an American history text on your bookshelf.</p>

<h2>Some graphs<a class="headerlink" href="#some-graphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our lens on the history of the United States is the federal government&#8217;s choices on spending and revenue.
We plot these series as a share of U.S. total output in the following figure.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/fed_expend_rev_gdp_1775_2011.png"><img alt="_images/fed_expend_rev_gdp_1775_2011.png" src="_images/fed_expend_rev_gdp_1775_2011.png" style="width: 720.0px; height: 540.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><strong>Federal Government Tax Revenue and Expenditures as a Percentage of GDP</strong></p>
</div>
<p>From the time series of tax revenue and expenditures, several patterns are apparent.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. Government spending spikes during each of the major wars: the
Revolutionary War from 1775 to 1783; the Civil War from 1861 to 1865;
America&#8217;s involvement in World War I in 1917 and 1918; and World War II from 1941 to 1945.</p>
<p>2. Tax revenue during these wars does not rise as dramatically
as spending.</p>
<p>3. After each of these wars, spending is slow to return to its pre-war level if it does at all.
In the years after the Civil War and World War I, revenues exceed spending.</p>
<p>4. Two peacetime increases in levels of both spending and tax revenue occur in 1790 and 1930s.
Both of these increases are permanent.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The difference between the government&#8217;s spending and its tax receipts its the government deficit, which we plot as a share of total output below</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/federal_gross_deficit_1770_2011.png"><img alt="_images/federal_gross_deficit_1770_2011.png" src="_images/federal_gross_deficit_1770_2011.png" style="width: 720.0px; height: 540.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><strong>Federal Government Deficit as a Percentage of GDP</strong></p>
</div>
<p>We note the following in the above graph.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. Deficits spike during the four major wars mentioned
above.</p>
<p>2. With the exception of these four wars, prior to the 1930s typically set expenditures less than or equal to revenue.
Hence deficits were either small or negative.</p>
<p>3.  After World War II, federal peacetime deficits become larger
and more volatile.</p>
<p>4.  The post-2008 deficit is of the magnitude
as the Civil War deficits.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As we will discuss in the next lecture, government deficits imply an increase in the government&#8217;s stock of debt (i.e. its outstanding borrowing).
We plot the evolution of the ratio of U.S. to its GDP below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/long_total_fed_debt_to_gdp.png"><img alt="_images/long_total_fed_debt_to_gdp.png" src="_images/long_total_fed_debt_to_gdp.png" style="width: 720.0px; height: 540.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><strong>Federal Debt to GDP Ratio</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Prior to the 1980s, increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio are associated with wartime spending.  The one exception to this is the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio during the 1930s.
During periods of peace, the GDP-to-GDP slowly diminished.</p>
<p>After the 1980, the debt-to-GDP as risen steady with a brief respite during the mid-1990s.</p>

<h3>Two Views on Debt<a class="headerlink" href="#two-views-on-debt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since the birth of our country, Americans have held disparate views on the benefits and risks of having an outstanding stock of government debt.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">To some Americans, public debt is an indicator of weakness and a burden on future generations.  An early articulation of this view was expressed by the father of our country, President George Washington is his <a class="reference external" href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp">Farewell Address</a> on Sep. 17, 1796</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is, to use it as sparingly as possible; avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but remembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts, which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burthen, which we ourselves ought to bear.</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Other Americans have argued that a modest quantity debt can be a &#8220;national blessing&#8221; or at least nothing to be terribly concerned with.  An example of this more benign view of debt was recently expressed by Paul Krugman in his <em>New York Times</em> op-ed &#8220;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/krugman-nobody-understands-debt.html?_r=0">Nobody Understands Debt</a>&#8221;. On January 1, 2012 he wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Deficit-worriers portray a future in which we&#8217;re impoverished by the need to pay back money we&#8217;ve been borrowing. They see America as being like a family that took out too large a mortgage, and will have a hard time making the monthly payments.</em></p>
<p><em>This is, however, a really bad analogy in at least two ways.</em></p>
<p><em>First, families have to pay back their debt. Governments don&#8217;t &#8211; all they need to do is ensure that debt grows more slowly than their tax base. The debt from World War II was never repaid; it just became increasingly irrelevant as the U.S. economy grew, and with it the income subject to taxation.</em></p>
<p><em>Second &#8211; and this is the point almost nobody seems to get &#8211; an over-borrowed family owes money to someone else; U.S. debt is, to a large extent, money we owe to ourselves.</em></p>
<p><span class="math">\(\vdots\)</span></p>
<p><em>We need more, not less, government spending to get us out of our unemployment trap. And the wrongheaded, ill-informed obsession with debt is standing in the way.</em></p>

<h2>Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the lectures presented in this website, we wish to address the following questions</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. Is debt a &#8220;virtue&#8221; (or at least not that big a deal) or is it
an &#8220;evil&#8221;?</p>
<p>2. How should a government finance large temporary expenditures
(e.g. wars)?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>How should one fund a rebellion?</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>3. How should a government finance large permanent expenditures
(e.g. medicare)?</p>
<p>4. When should and shouldn&#8217;t government pay back their
debts?</p>
<p>5. When should the federal government bailout the states? and
vice versa?</p>
