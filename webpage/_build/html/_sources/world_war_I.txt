Key Events Prior to War

    * 1907 Panic

    * 1913 Income Tax

    * 1913-1914 Establishment of the Federal Reserve System

    * 1914 New York Stock Exchange shut down for nearly five months


The Panic of 1907

* 1907

     * No central bank

     * No deposit insurance, but clearing houses

* Recall how a bank works

     * takes deposits

     * make loans, keeps less that 25\% of deposits on reserve

* Fall 1907: Concerns about losses in copper speculation

* On October 22 a bank run on the Knickerbock Trust Company

     * second largest trust company in New York

     * Trust is a bank that does not issue currency, faced fewer regulations

           * part of the `shadow banking`_ system, outside clearing house system

.. _shadow banking: https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2013/06/basics.htm

     * in two hours, paid out \$8 million

     * closed their doors

* Contagion spread to other trusts and banks

     * many bank closed their doors/suspended convertibility

* regional stock markets closed

* In response, J.P Morgan, the U.S. Treasury, John D. Rockefeller

     * reviewed bank books, decided which were solvent, made loans

     * even they did not have enough resources to hold back the tide

     * convinced banks to pool resources, help each other out

* Sharp contraction of the money supply led to a severe recession


Stopping a Banking Panic

* U.S. is on the gold standard

* U.S. is a net debtor

    * foreign holdings of U.S. assets: \$6 billion

    * U.S. holdings of foreign assets: \$1 billion

How to Pay for the War? Taxes or Debt?
======================================

* McAdoo studies Chase's financing of the Civil War

     * learns what not to do

     * no mention of Gallatin

* Can not borrow from abroad.

* Disparate Opinions

     * Chair of Senate Finance Committee: debt finance

     * J.P. Morgan: taxes, not exceed 20\%

     * "leading economists": primarily taxes

     * McAddo: 1/2 - 1/2; later 1/3 taxes, 2/3 debt

Theory at the Time
------------------

* High taxes would control inflation

* Taxation was fairer

    * placed the burden on those who could best afford it

    * with loans, a soldier drafted in the army would suffer doubly

       1. while serving in the army
       
       2. higher taxes when he returned

Borrowing: The Liberty Loans
----------------------------

* April 28, 1917 First Liberty Loan approved

* just 20 days after war declared

* By 1917, no expectation that the war would be short and cheap

* immediate move to long-term borrowing

    **Debt-to-GDP Ratio**


Designing the Liberty Loans
---------------------------


* McAdoo wanted to minimize cost to the taxpayer

* He also wanted no failed offering

* did not want to rely on short-term borrowing or fiat money

Prior to the war, interest on Treasury bonds had been tax exempt


   * problem: tax exemption only valuable to high-income buyers

   * low coupon rates made the bonds less attractive to middle-income buyers

   * wanted middle class to invest in bonds, so that after the war the country would not be taxing the poor to repay the rich.

   * aligning future politics for repayment

* Concern that as the war would do on, interest rates would rise

Liberty Loans
-------------

Contractual provisions

1. To mitigate the risk that an investor's securities would depreciate
   if rising interest rates later forced the Treasury to sell higher 
   coupon debt, the Treasury sold bonds that could converted into new 
   bonds earning the higher rate.  (Ghost of the War of 1812)

2. To attract high-income investors during a period of temporary high 
   tax rates, the Treasury sold bonds with tax exemptions limited to the duration of the war.

3. Also sold interconvertible notes with various coupon rates and tax provision.

From Garbade, page 144

The Selling of the Liberty Loans
--------------------------------

* Loans too big to sell just to banks

* No ability to sell to foreigners

* McAdoo did not want pay for a "Jay Cooke" middleman.  He stated

.. epigraph:: 

    We went directly to the people: and that means to everybody -- to businessmen, workmen,
    farmers, bankers, millionaires, schoolteachers, laborers.  We capitalized the profound
    impulse called patriotism.


Cite  Crowded Years 
Fund drives, McAdoo, celebrities

Like Jay Cooke, sold bonds in small denominations on installments

Post-War Tax Reductions
-----------------------

Both Presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge advocated for lower taxes

   * eliminate the excess-profit tax

   * reduce surcharges on individual incomes

Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon made a "supply-side" case for lower taxes.
Argued that high upper bracket tax rates

   1. stifled initiative

   2. diverted investment to tax-exempt state and local bonds

   3. reduced federal tax revenue

Thus **lower** rates would lead to **more** tax revenue.

Post-War Refinancing
---------------------

* In October 1919, \$26.2 billion in debt

     * May 1923, Victory Loans due, \$4.5 billion

     * 1928, Third Liberty Loan due \$4.0 billion

     * nothing else due until 1938

* Secretary Mellon want to refinance these loans to smooth out the payments

* Move from "project finance" market to a liquid national securities market to sustain a permanent national debt

* Treasury bonds introduced in 1922

* Treasury bills introduced in 1929

* Is debt a "blessing" or an "evil"?

     **Contributions to Changes in the Debt-to-GDP Ratio**


Evolution of the Debt Ceiling
=============================

Prior to WWI, Congress issued bonds for a specific purpose

* specify amount *issued* on long-term debt

* specify amount *outstanding* on short-term (i.e. cash management) debt

In 1920, the Treasury faced three limits

1. \$10 billion in certificates of indebtedness outstanding

2. \$7.5 billion in notes outstanding

3. \$20 billion in bonds that can be issued

In 1929, Secretary Mellon wanted to issue \$8 billion in new bonds
  
  * to refinance existing debt

  * but threatened to put the Treasury over the limit on issues

He wrote to Congress

.. epigraph::

    [I]t is obvious that the orderly and economical management of the public debt
    requires that the Treasury Department have complete freedom in determining
    the character of securities to be issued and should not be confronted with
    any arbitrary limitation which was not intended to apply to these circumstances.

* Congress raised the limit on bonds to \$25 billion.

* In 1938, Congress raised the limit on bonds from \$25 to \$30 billion

    * there were over \$20 billion outstanding

    * aggregate limit set to \$45 billion

* In 1939, Congress removed the \$30 billion cap on bonds, leaving the total limit unchanged.

The Dollar Becomes a World Currency
-----------------------------------

* Prior to the war

    * British pound is the world's *vehicle currency*.

    * Britain is the go-to world's creditor

* U.S. is a net debtor

* During the war

    * Britain imposes controls on gold, the U.S. (for the most part) does not

    * Britain stops lending to the rest of the world, U.S. steps into the void

* Exiting the war

    * Britain is financial exhausted -- it debt to the U.S.

    * Treasury debt is a considered a safe, liquid investment

Modern Treasury Market
----------------------

The Treasury in 2014 offers only four types of marketable securities

*  *Treasury Bills* - pure discount security with a maturity one year or less

     * first issued in 1929


* *Treasury Notes and Bonds* -- coupon securities, payment semi-annual,

      * notes -- maturity less than ten years

      * bonds -- any maturity
 
* *TIPS* -- coupon bond whose interest and principal payments are linked to the CPI

      * introduced in 1997
