State Finances
**************

Pre-1790 State and Local Finance
================================

* America was built bottom up, rather than top down

      * local government most important,

            * property taxes

* colonial government, then

* central government relatively unimportant

* This changes in 1790

     * transfer of revenue from state to federal government

     * little impact on local government

State Revenues 1790-1812
------------------------

* Some states received federal bonds for the Revolutionary debts they had retired

    * received interest

* Bank stocks

    * Hamilton encouraged states to charter banks

* sale of public lands

    * states acquired title to all lands within their boarders

    * properties confiscated from the British and loyalists

    * strong market for these properties

Existing States are in Good Fiscal Shape 1790-1812
--------------------------------------------------

* No debt

* Steady revenue streams from investments

* Many eliminate property taxes

     * New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Hampshire

* New states had little investment income

     * land revenue went to federal government

     * had to rely heavily on property taxes

After the War of 1812
---------------------

* States began to borrow money

* Internal Improvements

    * New York:  1817 Erie Canal

    * Pennsylvania: 1820s series of canals

    * Chesapeake and Ohio Canal

    * South: Banks

* Prevailing view: bonds would be self-financing

    * ultimately promote growth and larger state government tax receipts

          * direct fees or taxes on increased land values

State Borrowing
----------------

* Between 1815 and 1840  U.S. states borrowed more than \$200 million by selling long-term bonds in domestic and 
  international financial markets to

     * transportation

     * banking

* Federal debt is steadily declining during this period.


State Bonds Were Popular with European Investors
------------------------------------------------

* Example: Pennsylvania, 1842 par value: \$34.5 million.

    * England: over \$20 million

    * Holland \$1.8 million

    * France \$570,000

* Sold on the argument that these projects were self-financing

* State bonds benefited from the hard earned good reputation of the federal government

* Implicit federal backing of state debts?

     * Hamilton's assumption in 1790

     * U.S. Constitution


Article IV, Section 1 of U.S. Constitution
-------------------------------------------

Mandates strong protection for owners of state debts:

.. epigraph::

    Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records,
    and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress
    may by general
    Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall
    be proved, and the Effect thereof.

Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
-------------------------------------------

.. epigraph::

    The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed
    to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted
    against one of the United States by Citizens of another State;
    or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State

* 1793, after a citizen of state had taken a grievance against another state to federal court

* Weakens investor protection of state debts

* Local debts are still enforceable in state courts (e.g. Stockton, CA)

State Debt Crisis of the 1840s
------------------------------

* Major financial panic and recession in 1837

      * became clear that many of these state projects are not going to be self-financing

* In 1841, state debts outstanding totaled \$198 million.

    * federal debt near zero

    * At peak, in 1815, federal debt around \$140 million

* In 1841 and 1842, eight states and the territory of Florida defaulted on their debts.

    * Three other states narrowly avoided default.

    * Five of the nine defaulting states repudiated all or part of their debts.

*To the Pennsylvanians*

by William Wordsworth

.. epigraph::

     Days undefiled by luxury or sloth,
     
     Firm self-denial, manners grave and staid,
     
     Rights equal, laws with cheerfulness obeyed,
 
     Words that require no sanction from an oath,
 
     And simple honesty a common growth--
 
     This high repute, with bounteous Nature's aid,
 
     Won confidence, now ruthlessly betrayed
     
     At will, your power the measure of your troth!--
     
     All who revere the memory of Penn
     
     Grieve for the land on whose wild woods his name

     Was fondly grafted with a virtuous aim,

     Renounced, abandoned by degenerate Men

     For state-dishonour black as ever came

     To upper air from Mammon's loathsome den

Bailout or No Bailout?
----------------------

During the 1840s Congress debated but ultimately rejected proposals
for the federal government to pay the state debts

* Proponents: Precedent set by Hamilton in 1790

* Opponents: Hamilton bailed out the states incurred for a Glorious national purpose

      * current state debts incurred to finance local projects

Whose Reputation?
-----------------

* Borrowing costs for non-defaulting states rose

* In 1842 the federal government tried to sell bonds in Europe

     * U.S. agents told U.S. bonds would not be accepted

* Was it leverage by a cartel of European banks to induce the federal government to assume the state debts?

      * European banks were willing to lend money to the federal government if part of funds were used to pay state debts.

State Balanced Budget Amendments
--------------------------------

* More than half the states rewrote their constitutions to require year-by-year balanced budgets.

* Today every state, except Vermont, has a balanced budget amendment.

* Rules out Gallatin-Barro tax smoothing.

Lessons for Europe?  Lessons for U.S. states and municipalities?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* U.S. states and municipalities

    * large pension obligations

    * municipal debts for public works

    * Stockton, California and Detroit, Michigan

* Europe

    * Greece

    * Cyprus

* Maintain distinct reputations with different parties?
