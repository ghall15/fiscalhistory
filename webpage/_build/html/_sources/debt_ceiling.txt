The Debt Ceiling
****************

The U.S. Constitution unambiguously grants Congress the sole power to direct spending, collect taxes, and
borrow money. 

Article 1, Section 8, states

.. epigraph::

     The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the 
     Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, 
     Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;

     To borrow money on the credit of the United States;

Absent from the Constitution are any specifics as to how the United States' credit ought to be managed.

Over the last two centuries Congress has expanded gradually the Treasury's authority to manage the 
federal debt. Today 
the Treasury has a free rein to determine the maturity composition of the debt.  But the 
Treasury is subject to 
a constraint that the total quantity of debt not exceed a threshold set by Congress.

Looking at the government budget constraint, this arrangement is quite puzzling.

.. math::
     B_{t} =  B_{t-1} + INT_t + G_t + TR_t - T_t

As we discussed in the second lecture, the value of outstanding debt, :math:`B_{t-1}`, and the 
interest payments, :math:`INT_t` are determined by 
Congress's past choices on spending and taxes.  Congress then chooses current values 
of :math:`G_t`, :math:`TR_t` and :math:`T_t`.  By simple arithmetic, these choices imply
a stock of debt next period, :math:`B_t`  

The debt ceiling or debt limit, also set by Congress, states that the debt, :math:`B_t` cannot 
exceed some pre-set level.

Thus if the Congress sets the debt limit (or fails to increase the debt limit) such that 
the value of debt implied by its own spending and tax choices exceed that limit, 
the Treasury is placed in the 
untenable position of not having the authority to make the payments Congress had previously 
directed it to honor. 

Further constraining the Treasury's choices is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.  Section 4 of this Amendment states

.. epigraph::

     The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment 
     of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.

Hence if the debt limit is exceeded, the Treasury must make one of the following three choices

   1.  Reduce government expenditures, :math:`G_t` and/or :math:`TR_t`, below the levels authorized by Congress, violating Article 1, Section 8.
   
   2.  Increase tax revenue, :math:`T_t`, above the levels authorized by Congress, violating Article 1, Section 8.

   3.  Default on some portion of the debt :math:`B_t` and/or promised interest payments :math:`INT_t`, violating the 14th Amendment.

Advocates of the debt ceiling argue that it provides a natural and automatic review of current spending and 
revenue policies whenever the current path of debt requires an increase in the existing ceiling.
[Krishnakumar2005]_, page 171 reckons that the "elimination of the debt limit would absolve Congress of its
accountability for government borrowing ..." and "... could encourage the worst tendencies of interest group
politics -- i.e., rampant logrolling with little incentive at any level of government to worry about the
growth of the national debt ..." 
   
In this lecture we review the history of Congress' delegation to the Treasury the authority to issue new debt and
management existing debt subject to Congressional limits.  We then discuss the self-imposed limits on government 
debt at the state level.
   
The Evolution of Statutory Limits on the Treasury
==================================================   
   
For the first 45 years after the ratification of the Constitution, if the government wished to borrow money, 
Congress drafted specific legislation to authorize 
the quantity of debt that could be **issued.**  

During this period, all long term debt was authorized to 
finance for a specific purpose: the refinance the Revolutionary debt, to finance the Louisiana Purchase, and 
to finance the War of 1812.  It was expected that these long-term debt issued would be retired at maturity.  
If they were to be refinanced, Congress would pass legislation authorizing this refunding.

If the Treasury wished to obtain a temporary loan from the Bank of the United States 
or the Bank of the New York to cover the mismatch of short-run flows in and out of the Treasury, Congress 
would authorize the size of the loan.
 
During the War of 1812, the Treasury issued five short-term Treasury notes, but each of these issues was 
authorized by specific legislative by Congress in which Congress authorized the quantity of notes that could *issued*.

By 1836, the federal debt was extinguished for all practical purposes.  The little remaining debt consisted 
unclaimed interest and old Treasury notes and claims for services and supplies in which evidence 
of the debt had been lost of destroyed.  The surplus in the Treasury far exceeded the little debt.  
Under the act of June 23, 1836 \$28 million in surplus revenue was turned over to the states.

By 1837 as the country fell into a depression, the fiscal fortunes of the federal government changed drastically. 
Thus the Secretary of the Treasury asked Congress for contingent authority to issue up to $12 million in 
Treasury notes to cover any forthcoming deficits.  

Since these Treasury Notes were one year loans, they required re-authorization in 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 
1842 and 1843.  In the 1840 reauthorization, Congress switched from specifying that amount of Notes
that the Treasury may *issue* to the amount that may be *outstanding*. See [Bayley1882]_, page 67-68.

On May 13, 1846 the U.S. declared war on Mexico.  To finance the war effort, Congress authorized the 
Treasury to issue both one-year notes as well as a 10 year bond.   The second section of the Act of 
July 22, 1846 `An Act to authorize an Issue of Treasury Notes and a Loan`_
stated

.. epigraph::

   ... the President, if in his opinion it shall be in the interest of the United States to do, instead of
   issuing the whole amount of treasury notes authorized by the first section of this act, may borrow on the 
   credit of the United States such an amount of money as he may deem proper, and issue therefor stock
   of the United States for the sum thus borrowed, in the same form, and under the same restrictions, limitations,
   and provisions, as contained in the act of Congress, approved April fifteenth, one thousand eight 
   hundred and forty-two entitled "An Act for the Extension of the Loan of eighteen hundred and forty-one,
   and for an Addition of five million of Dollars thereto, and for allowing Interest on Treasury Notes due." 
   *Provided, however,* That the sum so borrowed, together with the Treasury notes issued by virtue of this act,
   shall not exceed the sum of ten million dollars:

Hence Congress granted the President the discretion to manage the composition of the debt he saw fit between 
one-year Treasury Notes and ten-year bonds; but Congress limited the overall quantity of debt the President could issue
to \$10 million.

For the next 85 years, until the 1920s, Congress treated Treasury Notes and other short-term loans
differently from long-term bond issues.  
During this period, legislation authorizing short debt typically specified a limit on how much can be *outstanding*, 
while the legislation
authorizing long-term debt specified a limit on the quantity of debt *issued.*

The following is taken largely from [Garbade2012]_ chapter 21.

After World War I, the U.S. was left with \$20 billion in long-term Liberty bonds and \$5 
billion in other loans with much of this debt due within a five year window.

In facilitate of smoother paydown of the war debt and to create a more liquid market for Treasury securities, during the 
1920s developed a program of exchanging Liberty bonds for a new set of securities that would
issued on a "regular and predictable" basis. These securities were:

  1.  Treasury Bills -- a zero coupon bonds with a maturity less than a year.

  2. Certificates of Indebtedness -- coupon bonds with a maturity less than a year.

  3.  Treasury Notes -- coupon bonds with a maturity no more than five years [#]_.
  
  4.  Treasury Bonds -- coupon bonds usually with a maturity of 30 years.

In 1929 there were three restrictions on Treasury debt management:

   1.  the quantity of outstanding bills and certificates of indebtedness (i.e. securities with a maturity of less than 
       one year ) could not exceed $10 billion.

   2.  the quantity of outstanding Treasury notes could not exceed $7.5 billions.

   3. authority to issue up to \$20 billion of Treasury bonds.

As in previous eras, Congress distinguished between short-term "cash management" borrowing 
on which it placed limits on the quantity outstanding and long-term borrowing on which it placed limits on the quantity
issued.  However, by the early 1920s Congress had expanded the class of securities it 
considered short term to include bonds with a maturity 
up to five years.

During the 1930s Secretary of the Treasury `Andrew Mellon`_ and later Secretary `Henry Morgenthau`_ repeatedly 
requested from Congress greater
latitude in determining in the composition of debt.  Congress steadily acceded to these requests. 

In 1939 Congress granted the Treasury complete discretion in managing the maturity structure of both new issues and
existing debt; however Congress did impose a single statutory limit of the total outstanding stock of debt.

State Level Debt Restrictions
=============================

During the late 1830s and into 1840s, at the same time Congress was relaxing the constraints the discretion of the Treasury, 
individual states
were incorporating debt limits into to their own constitutions.  The self-imposed restrictions were in response
to a wave of defaults of state debt during this period. 

In these revisions, most states are forbidden from issuing debt
to cover general appropriations without approval from the majority of voters in a general election 
or legislative supermajorities.  Most state constitutions
do allow the government to issue

  * short-term debt in anticipation of specific revenue within the current fiscal year,
  
  * debt in response to military emergencies and natural disasters, and
  
  * new debt to refund existing debt
  
without voter approval of a specific referendum.
  
All states may issue debt to finance a distinctly specified public works project.  

Many state constitutions place limits on the borrowing of their municipalities and forbid the state from assuming 
any municipal debt.
