A Fiscal Crisis 230 Years Ago
==============================

In the 1780s after the Revolutionary War, the U.S. was a fiscal basket case.

The country had just come off a hyperinflation.  The Continental government had no 
currency worth speaking of.  The government had large debts which traded well below par and 
no stable revenue stream

There was no army or navy worth speaking of.

There were no effective capital markets.

* Case study of a successful management of a fiscal crisis

* resolved by creating a new constitution (second revolution?)

* compromise and a bailout (grand bargain?)

* Similarities between Europe today and the U.S. then

Articles of Confederation
==========================

America's first consitution, the Articles of Confederation were
agreed to by the Continental Congress on November 15, 1777 and
went into effect after the ratification by Maryland on March 1, 1781.

The full text of this document is available from the `Library of Congress`_.

.. _Library of Congress: http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/articles.html

The Article established a fiscal union with strong states and a weak central government.

The federal government had no power to tax, but could only ask the states for resources.

         * All taxation, both tariffs and internal revenue, belonged to the states.

         * Continental government could borrow

Financial Provisions of the Articles of Confederation
------------------------------------------------------

VIII.

All charges of war, and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defense or
general welfare, and allowed by the United States in Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of
a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the several States in proportion to the value of all
land within each State, granted or surveyed for any person, as such land and the buildings and
improvements thereon shall be estimated according to such mode as the United States in Congress
assembled, shall from time to time direct and appoint.

The taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction of
the legislatures of the several States within the time agreed upon by the United States in
Congress assembled.

* In practice, expenses of Congress and expenditures of the states toward "the common
    defense and general welfare" lumped together into *common charges*.

A state's contribution was based on the wealth of each state, not the population.
 
* If one state contributed

    * more than its share, received a credit
    * less than it share, received a debit

* Many of the states made claims for costs during the war that had not been pre-approved by the Congress

* New England states better at book-keeping than the southern states

Financial Provisions of the Articles of Confederation
------------------------------------------------------

IX.

The United States in Congress assembled shall never engage in a war, nor grant letters of marque
or reprisal in time of peace, nor enter into any treaties or alliances, nor coin money, nor
regulate the value thereof, nor ascertain the sums and expenses necessary for the defense and
welfare of the United States, or any of them, nor emit bills, nor borrow money on the credit of
the United States, nor appropriate money, nor agree upon the number of vessels of war, to be built
or purchased, or the number of land or sea forces to be raised, nor appoint a commander in chief
of the army or navy, unless nine States assent to the same: nor shall a question on any other
point, except for adjourning from day to day be determined, unless by the votes of the majority of
the United States in Congress assembled.

XII.

All bills of credit emitted, monies borrowed, and debts contracted by, or under the authority of
Congress, before the assembling of the United States, in pursuance of the present confederation,
shall be deemed and considered as a charge against the United States, for payment and satisfaction
whereof the said United States, and the public faith are hereby solemnly pledged.

A Curious Set Up
-----------------

As Dewey [Dewey1903], page 49

* omissions more important than the provisions

* Congress had the power to take on debt, but no power to fund the debt


By 1782, with its ability to print money exhausted and hamstrung in its ability to tax 
under the Articles of Confederation, the  Continental Congress's revenues plummeted.

The Continental Congress was unable to raise sufficient revenue to pay the interest payments on its debt,  
much less any promised  principal payments.  

It was forced to set non-interest spending equal to its meager receipts.

In 1784, it owed \$2 million in promised interest payments (not including those in arrears), 
but  received only \$723,000 in revenue.

    **Per Capita Continental Government Primary Deficit**

As illustrated in figure above, unable to borrow any further, the government set spending equal to revenue, 
deferring nearly all interest payments.

Over the next seven years, the interest-bearing debt grew to \$53 million largely through the accumulation of interest payments in arrears.

Throughout the 1780s, repayment of the Revolutionary debt remained in doubt, as indicated by its being traded at about  20 percent of its face value.  The domestic debt was divided between explicit loans from the Continental government, known as the loan office certificates, and the final settlement certificates, which represented promises to civilians and soldiers to redeem  unpaid  
bills and wages.  

Ferguson argues that the loan office certificates  were the "best part of the debt"
and consistently traded at higher prices than the final settlement certificates.  

Most speculative trade occurred in final settlement certificates, particularly those issued to Revolutionary
soldiers and officers who typically sold their securities soon after receiving them.

As we will see below, Hamilton ultimately treated owners of loan office certificates
and final settlement certificates equally.

The Fiscal Crisis
------------------

States refused to send enough revenue to the Federal government to

     * pay the interest on the debt, much less principal
     * fund an army or navy
     * pay promised pension payments

Foreign shippers played one state off against another

Domestic debt traded around 20 percent of par value


Par Value vs. Market Value of Debt
==================================

* Question:  How much debt is outstanding?

* *Par value* is total principal outstanding

* value every bond at par (i.e. \$100)

* *Market value* is how much it would cost to buy all the debt outstanding

     * value every bond :math:`i` at its current market price (i.e. :math:`V^i_t`)
     * total market value it is :math:`\sum_{i}  V^i_t \times P^i`

* We will do an example.
