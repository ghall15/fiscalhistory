<p>As we mentioned in the previous lecture, government deficits (i.e. the difference between spending and tax revenues) imply an increase in the nation&#8217;s public debt.</p>
<p>Debts and deficits are linked through an equation called the government budget constraint.</p>
<p>You may be familiar with this is a relationship between the flow of deficit spending and the stock of debt from your credit card account.</p>
<div class="section" id="your-credit-card-bill">
<h2>Your Credit Card Bill<a class="headerlink" href="#your-credit-card-bill" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have a credit card, you get a bill each month.  It probably looks something like this.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/creditbill.jpg"><img alt="_images/creditbill.jpg" class="align-center" src="_images/creditbill.jpg" style="width: 560.0px; height: 477.6px;" /></a>
<p>Under the heading &#8220;Here is your Account Summary,&#8221; the holder&#8217;s new balance is determined by the equation:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\mbox{New Balance}  &amp;=&amp;  \mbox{Previous Balance} \\
&amp; + &amp; \mbox{ Finance Charge} \\
&amp; + &amp; \mbox{ New Purchases} \\
&amp; - &amp; \mbox{ Payments}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s re-write this equation as</p>
<div class="math">
\[B_t  =  B_{t-1} + r B_{t-1} + G_t - T_t\]</div>
<p>where we let</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(B\)</span> denote the balance,</li>
<li><span class="math">\(r\)</span> denote the monthly interest rate (so <span class="math">\(rB\)</span> is the finance charge),</li>
<li><span class="math">\(G\)</span> be new purchases, and</li>
<li><span class="math">\(T\)</span> be payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we proceed any further, let&#8217;s recall the distinction between <em>stock</em> and <em>flow</em> variables.</p>
<div class="section" id="stock-variables-and-flow-variables">
<h3>Stock Variables and Flow Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#stock-variables-and-flow-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Stock variables</em> are measured at a point in time.  In example of a stock variable is the location of your car on a highway.  At 1 o&#8217;clock on Tuesday you were at mile marker 43.</p>
<p><em>Flow variables</em> are measured over a period of time.  An example of a flow variable is the speed of your car &#8211; measured in miles per hour.  Between 1 o&#8217;clock and 2 o&#8217;clock, you traveled 60 miles.</p>
<p>So for your credit card</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(B\)</span> is a stock variable.  It is the quantity of debt you owe <em>at a particular point in time</em>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(r B\)</span>,  <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(T\)</span> are flow variables.  They represent how much you spent and paid <em>over a period of time</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We call equations that link flow variables to their corresponding stock variables, stock-flow equations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>The Government Budget Constraint<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Just as your credit card balance evolves from month to month, a sovereign government&#8217;s debt
evolves period to period according to a stock-flow equation we call
the government budget constraint.</p>
<p>At each date <span class="math">\(t\)</span>:, the following equation must hold.</p>
<div class="math">
\[B_{t} =  B_{t-1} + r B_{t-1} + G_t + TR_t - T_t\]</div>
<p>where</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}G_t  &amp;=&amp; \mbox{government purchases during period } t \\
TR_t &amp;=&amp; \mbox{transfer payments (e.g. social security) during period } t \\
T_t &amp;=&amp; \mbox{taxes collected during period } t \\
B_{t}  &amp;=&amp; \mbox{this period's } t \mbox{ government debt} \\
r  &amp;=&amp; \mbox{real interest rate}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>You may have seen this equation in one form or another when you took macroeconomics.
Many undergraduate macroeconomics textbooks write it this way</p>
<div class="math">
\[B_{t} =  B_{t-1} + INT_t + G_t + TR_t - T_t\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(INT_t\)</span> denotes <em>net interest payments</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="defining-government-outlays">
<h3>Defining Government Outlays<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-government-outlays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Government purchases</em> are government expenditures on newly produced goods and services.
These goods and services are valued at their cost to the government.  Examples of government purchases
include the provision of public education and national defense and the building of roads.</p>
<p><em>Transfer payments</em> on the other hand is spending in which the government redistributes income.
These are payments for which government does not receive a good or a service in return.
It simply writes check to a particular group.
Examples of transfer payments include Medicare, Social Security, and unemployment insurance.</p>
<p><em>Net interest payments</em> are the interest paid to government creditors less the interest paid to the government by
its debtors (e.g. government loans to small businesses or farmers).  As we will see below, there is more than one
way to measure the costs the government pays to borrow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fiscal-accounts">
<h2>Fiscal Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#fiscal-accounts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Up to this point we have just referred to &#8220;the government.&#8221;  Of course in the United States,
at any point in time most people fall under the jurisdiction of three governments simultaneously:
the federal government, the state government and the local government.</p>
<p>The composition of spending and revenue differ considerably across these three levels.
At times, it will be useful to lump all three together; but at other times, it be will be
important to consider the each level separately.</p>
<p>Making comparisons across levels of government can be tricky. Spending and revenue choices
are the outcome of the budget process which differ across governments. Different governments can operate
on different fiscal years and employ different budget practices.  For example, some government
count the sale of bonds and or public assets as &#8220;revenue&#8221; while other do not <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id2">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) creates a set of accounts that is consistent
across all three levels of government.</p>
<p>We first focus on describing the fiscal accounts of the federal government.
The federal government reports its receipts, expenditures, and
interest payments in two places: the annual budget issued by the Treasury
and the Office of Managment and Budget (OMB) and National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)
computed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis .</p>
<div class="section" id="omb">
<h3>OMB<a class="headerlink" href="#omb" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Federal government spending and revenue are determined by its annual budgets
passed by Congress and signed by the President.  Since 1934, these budget numbers
are reported by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget">Office of Management and Budget (OMB)</a>.</p>
<p>Budget spending and revenue number are reported by the fiscal year.</p>
<p>The federal government operates on a fiscal year which begins on October 1 and ends on
September 30 of the next calendar year.
Prior to 1976, the federal fiscal year began on July 1 and ended on June 30.</p>
<p>The federal budget divides government spending into five categories known as <em>superfunctions</em>.  These
categories include all spending for a given topic, regardless of the federal agency that oversees the
individual federal program.</p>
<p>The five superfunctions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>national defense</li>
<li>human resources</li>
<li>physical resources</li>
<li>net interest</li>
<li>other</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Spending within these superfunctions are broken down further into twenty functions.</p>
<p>Revenues</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="u-s-treasury">
<h3>U.S. Treasury<a class="headerlink" href="#u-s-treasury" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Between 1790 and 1940, the U.S. Treasury reported the budget numbers.  These numbers are available
from the <a class="reference external" href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publication/?pid=194">Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the State of the Finances</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to 1940 there were five primary (or top level) categories</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>war</li>
<li>navy</li>
<li>pensions</li>
<li>Indians</li>
<li>interest</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Government spending is also recorded by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in
a second set of accounts: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm">the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)</a></p>
<p>These accounts begin in 1929.</p>
<p>Unlike the budget number reported by the OMB, the numbers reported by the NIPA are quarter and based on the
calendar year. The NIPA also provides a consistent accounting with state and local government accounts as
well as GDP</p>
<p>Government expenditures within the NIPA are decomposed into four primary or top level categories</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Government consumption, <span class="math">\(G_t\)</span></li>
<li>Transfer payments, <span class="math">\(TR_t\)</span></li>
<li>Net interest payments, <span class="math">\(INT_t\)</span></li>

<p>When we look over the entire history of the U.S., prior to the Civil War, the

<h3>A Digression on the U.S. Debt<a class="headerlink" href="#a-digression-on-the-u-s-debt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each month, the Bureau of the Public Debt within the U.S. Treasury
publishes the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.savingsbonds.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/mspd.htm">U.S. Treasury Monthly Statement of the Public Debt</a>.</p>
<p>In this statement, the total outstanding
debt is partitioned two different ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>marketable and non-marketable; and</li>
<li>held by the public and held within the government.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After being issued by the Treasury, ownership of marketable securities
can be transferred through purchases and sales in the secondary
market.  Marketable securities are largely made up of Treasury bills,
notes, bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).</p>
<p>In contrast, non-marketable securities are registered to the owner and
cannot be sold in the secondary market, though typically they can be
redeemed on demand.</p>
<p>Yields on nonmarketable securities are set
administratively, usually by a formula based on the returns for
marketable debt.</p>
<p>The nonmarketable debt held by the public is largely
held by small investors in the form of savings bonds (U.S. Savings
Securities) or by state and local governments who by law must hold the
proceeds from their own debt issues in Treasury debt until they use
the funds.</p>
<p>The largest share of the nonmarketable debt,
is held  in the &#8220;Government Account Series&#8221;, a collection of bonds
mostly held by the Social Security trust fund.</p>
<p>While  marketable securities today represent the lion&#8217;s share of the
debt held by the public, this has not always been the case.</p>
<p>In the figure below, we plot the debt-GDP ratio for three
different measures of the debt:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the marketable debt held by the public;</li>
</ol>
<p>2. the sum of the marketable and the nonmarketable debt held
by the public; and</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>the total outstanding debt.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Over the entire period, marketable debt has averaged about 80 percent of the total
debt held by the public (i.e the ratio of the solid-blue line to the
dashed-red line).</p>
<p>Early in the sample, this ratio was about
two-thirds, and it has steadily increased over time.</p>
<p>Nonmarketable
savings bonds and Victory loans played a much larger role in Treasury
borrowing during World War II and the Korean War than they do today.</p>
<p>Our focus on the government budget constraint compels us to concentrate
on the debt held by the public.</p>

<p>Since the signing of the U.S. Constitution,
the federal government can raise revenue by issuing money.  As we will see in a few lectures,
this power has been hotly contested.</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution explicitly states that state and local governments can not issue their own money.</p>
<p>Therefore the federal government&#8217;s budget constraint becomes</p>
<div class="math">

<h3>The Quantity Theory of Money<a class="headerlink" href="#the-quantity-theory-of-money" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>quantity theory of money</em> describes a simple
relationship between the money supply, the price level, and output.</p>
<p>It is based on the simple idea that money is just a means of carrying out transactions and
has no effect of the productive capacity of a country.</p>
<p>Think of nominal GDP as the volume of transactions executed in a country,</p>
<p>If we define velocity, <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, as the number of transactions each dollar can execute, then</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}Money \times Velocity &amp;=&amp; Price Level \times Real Output \\
M     \times  V       &amp;=&amp; P           \times   Y\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where we define</p>
<div class="math">
\[V \equiv \frac{\mbox{Nominal GDP}}{\mbox{nominal money stock}} = \frac{PY}{M}.\]</div>
<p>Thus for any values of <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>, we can compute a value of <span class="math">\(V\)</span> such that the
quantity theory holds. The give this theory any bite, we assume that velocity is roughly constant.</p>
<p>If we make this assumption of constant velocity, then this theory implies that
real money demand is proportional to real income.  So
<span class="math">\(\frac{M^d}{P} = kY\)</span> .</p>
<p>It is often useful to express the quantity theory in terms of growth rates.  If we take natural logs of both sides of the
equation, we get</p>
<div class="math">
\[\ln M_t   +  \ln V_t       =  \ln P_t +   \ln Y_t.\]</div>
<p>If we step back one period, we get</p>
<div class="math">
\[\ln M_{t-1}   +  \ln V_{t-1}       =  \ln P_{t-1} +   \ln Y_{t-1}.\]</div>
<p>Subtracting this second equation from the first yields,</p>
<div class="math">
\[(\ln M_{t}-\ln M_{t-1})   +  (\ln V_t - \ln V_{t-1})       =  (\ln P_t - \ln P_{t-1}) +   (\ln Y_t - \ln Y_{t-1})\]</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\Delta M}{M} + \frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{\Delta P}{P} + \frac{\Delta Y}{Y}.\]</div>
<p>Again if we assume velocity is constant over time, then</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\Delta M}{M}  = \frac{\Delta P}{P} + \frac{\Delta Y}{Y}.\]</div>

<h2>Money and Inflation<a class="headerlink" href="#money-and-inflation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inflation is the growth rate of the price level, which typically we measure by a price index such
as the consumer price index (CPI) or the GDP deflator.</p>
<p>If we denote inflation by <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>, we can write <span class="math">\(\pi = \frac{\Delta P}{P}\)</span></p>
<p>There is a famous quote from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman">Milton Friedman</a>, the winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in economics:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>This claim follows from the quantity theory. In a world without frictions,
output is determined by a country&#8217;s capital, labor and land.  Thus changes in the money
supply have not effect on the growth rate of the output.</p>
<p>If we assume velocity is fixed, the quantity theory of money implies that
changes in the money supply translate one-for-one into changes in the price level.  So
<span class="math">\(\pi = \frac{P_{t+1} - P_{t}}{P_t} = \frac{\Delta P}{P} =
\frac{\Delta M}{M}\)</span></p>
<p>Money had no effect on anything anybody cared about.  In other
words money is <em>neutral.</em></p>
<p>The classic dichotomy: money only changes the price level.</p>

<h3>Real seignorage and inflation<a class="headerlink" href="#real-seignorage-and-inflation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Consider our all-currency economy with no government debt.</p>
<p>If the velocity of money is fixed and output is fixed, so real money demand is constant. Then</p>
<div class="math">
\[\pi = \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{\Delta M}{M}\]</div>
<p>To derive real seignorage revenue, assume the government increase the money supply
by <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> percent each period.  Thus</p>
<div class="math">
\[M_{t} = (1+\mu)M_{t-1}\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{M_{t}-M_{t-1}}{M_{t-1}} = \frac{\Delta M}{M}  = \mu.\]</div>
<p>Seignorage revenue is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\frac{M_{t} - M_{t-1}}{P_t}  &amp;=&amp; \frac{\mu M_{t-1}}{P_t} \\
                             &amp;=&amp; \mu \frac{M_{t-1}}{P_t} \frac{P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} \\
                             &amp;=&amp; \mu \frac{P_{t-1}}{P_t} \frac{M_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} \\
                             &amp;=&amp; \frac{\mu}{1+\pi} \frac{M_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>If the inflation rate, <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> equals the money growth rate, <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> as implied by the quantity
theory of money, then seignorage revenue is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{M_{t} - M_{t-1}}{P_t}  = \frac{\mu}{1+\mu} \frac{M_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \frac{\mu}{1+\mu} \Phi\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\Phi\)</span> denotes the demand for real money balances.</p>
<p>So seignorage is a tax on real money balances.  The tax rate can be expressed either in terms
of the inflation rate or the money growth rate.</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\mu}{1+\mu}  = \frac{\pi}{1+\pi}\]</div>
<p>That&#8217;s why it is called the inflation tax.</p>
<p>The government collect revenue from the inflation tax when it
buys goods with newly printed money.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>So Friedman&#8217;s really should have said,</dt>
<dd><em>Inflation is always and everywhere a fiscal phenomenon.</em></dd>
</dl>
<p>Since seignorage is a distortionary tax, as the government
increases this tax, people will hold lower real balances.</p>
<p>Whether seignorage rises or falls depends on whether inflation
rises more or less than the decline in money holdings.  We will discuss
this in more detail in a couple of lectures.</p>
