<h2>The framers&#8217; hatred of paper money<a class="headerlink" href="#the-framers-hatred-of-paper-money" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The framers of the U.S. Constitution wanted to prevent the U.S. and the states from issuing and repudiating a currency again.</p>
<p>An earlier draft of the Constitution had actually given the Congress substantially more authority than that, including the right to issue bills of credit.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 16, 1787, the eighth clause of the seventh article in the draft of the constitution said
that &#8220;The legislature of the United States shall have the power to borrow money and emit bills on the credit of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp">Madison`s notes of the convention`s proceedings on August 16, 1787</a>  record a debate about a motion
to strike out the clause authorizing congress to emit bills of credit,
excerpts that impress us for their sophistication in</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. stressing the <em>ex ante</em> advantages in terms of promoting credit to be reaped by denying future
government decision makers the authority to take actions that <em>ex post</em>  would occasionally tempt
them (James Wilson)</p>
<p>2. appreciating  advantages of reserving for future decision makers the flexibility to deal with
unforeseeable contingencies (George Mason and Edmund Randolph); and</p>
<p>3. arguing that the most damaging effects from issuing a Federal paper money would be prevented if the
government could not make it  legal tender (James Madison).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On pages 67-68, Dewey discusses and cites the entire debate of August 16, including contributions we have omitted.</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from the debate:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Mr. Govr. MORRIS</strong> moved to strike out &#8220;and emit bills on the credit of the U. States&#8221; &#8211; If
the United States had credit such bills would be unnecessary: if they had not, unjust  &amp; useless.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. BUTLER</strong>, 2ds. the motion.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. MADISON</strong>, will it not be sufficient to prohibit the making them
a <em>[legal] tender</em>? This will remove the temptation to emit
them with unjust views. And promissory notes in that shape may in
some emergencies be best.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Govr. MORRIS.</strong> striking out the words will leave room still for
notes of a responsible minister which will do all the good without
the mischief. The Monied interest will oppose the plan of
Government, if paper emissions be not prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. GHORUM</strong> was for striking out, without inserting any prohibition.
if the words stand they may suggest and lead to the measure.</p>
<p><strong>Col.  MASON</strong> had doubts on the subject. Congs. he thought
would not have the power unless it were expressed. Though he had a
mortal hatred to paper money, yet <em>as he could not foresee all
emergences, he was unwilling to tie the hands of the Legislature.</em>
He observed that the late war could not have been carried on, had
such a prohibition existed.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. GHORUM</strong> The power as far as it will be necessary or safe, is involved in that of borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. MERCER</strong> was a friend to paper money, though in the present state  &amp; temper of America,
he should neither propose nor approve of such a measure.  He was consequently opposed
to a prohibition of it altogether. It will stamp suspicion on the Government to deny
it a discretion on this point. It was impolitic also to excite the opposition
of all those who were friends to paper money. The people of
property would be sure to be on the side of the plan, and it
was impolitic to purchase their further attachment with the loss of the opposite class of Citizens</p>
<p><strong>Mr. ELSEWORTH</strong> thought this a favorable moment to shut and bar the door against paper money.
The mischiefs of the various experiments which had been made, were
now fresh in the public mind and had excited the disgust of all
the respectable part of America. By withholding the power from the
new Governt. more friends of influence would be gained to it than
by almost any thing else. Paper money can in no case be necessary.
Give the Government credit, and other resources will offer. The
power may do harm, never good.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. RANDOLPH</strong>, notwithstanding his antipathy to paper money, could
not agree to strike out the words, as <em>he could not foresee
all the occasions which might arise.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. WILSON.</strong> It will have a most salutary influence on the credit
of the U. States to remove the possibility of paper money. This
expedient can never succeed whilst its mischiefs are remembered,
and as long as it can be resorted to, it will be a bar to other
resources.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. BUTLER.</strong> remarked that paper was a legal tender in no Country in Europe.
He was urgent for disarming the Government of such a power.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. MASON</strong> was still averse to tying the hands of the Legislature
altogether. If there was no example in Europe as just remarked, it
might be observed on the other side, that there was none in which
the Government was restrained on this head.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. READ,</strong> thought the words, if not struck out, would be as
alarming as the mark of the Beast in Revelations.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. LANGDON</strong> had rather reject the whole plan than retain the three
words &#8220;and emit bills&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the motion for striking out</p>
<p>N. H. ay. Mas. ay. Ct ay. N. J. no. Pa. ay. Del. ay. Md. no. Va.
ay. [FN23] N. C. ay. S. C. ay. Geo. ay.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The motion to strike out carried 9 states to 2, but the Convention did not  go further and
impose an explicit prohibition.</p>
<p>Thus, the framers opted for silence instead of  explicitly prohibiting the federal government
from issuing bills of credit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, during the first three quarters of the nineteenth century, it was widely believed
that the framers had intended to shut the door on making
a paper money a legal tender, and that the fact that they did not go further and
explicitly prohibit the federal government from issuing bills of credit simply reflected the
constitutional convention delegates&#8217; presumption that powers not explicitly awarded should be
understood to be denied to Congress.</p>
<p>Or could it have reflected a preference for leaving some ambiguity about their intentions
as a concession to George Mason&#8217;s argument about unforeseen contingencies.</p>
<p>His extensive review of the documentary record convinced
Bancroft (1886) that  the  framers intended that
Congress not be permitted to make a paper currency a legal tender:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>The refusal of the convention to confer on the legislature of the United States the power to emit bills of credit or irredeemable paper money in any form is so complete that according to all rules by which public documents are interpreted, it should not be treated as questionable;</em></div></blockquote>
<p>page 43 of Bancroft (1886).</p>
<p>To strengthen his point, Bancroft cited rousing statements from Washington, Madison, and
many others deploring the evils that flow when government makes
a paper currency a legal tender.</p>
<p>In light of the tone of the debate reported by Madison and  Bancroft&#8217;s evidence,
to represent the consensus of opinion before the civil war, Bancroft quoted Daniel Webster:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Most unquestionably there is no legal tender, and there can be no legal tender, in this country,
under the authority of this government or any other but gold and silver, either the coinage of our
own mints or foreign coins, at rates regulated by congress. This is a constitutional
principle, perfectly plain, and of the very highest importance. The states are expressly prohibited
from making anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts; and although no such express
prohibition is applied to congress, yet as congress has no power granted to it in this respect,
but to coin money and to regulate the value of foreign coins, it clearly has no power to substitute
paper, or anything else, for coin as a tender in payment of debts and in discharge of contracts.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>Extract from a speech delivered by Daniel Webster in the Senate of the United States on the 21st of December 1836 on the subject of the Specie Circular, quoted by citet[p.~93]{Bancroft1886}</p>
<p>page 93 of Bancroft</p>
<p>Bancroft&#8217;s review of the historical evidence was prompted by his disapproval of the Supreme Court&#8217;s 1884
decision in  <em>Juilliard v Greenman</em>, which uphold the Union&#8217;s making greenback a legal tender during the civil war.</p>
<p>The court reasoned that because Congress had the power to pay debts,  it could do so by any means not expressly
prohibited by the constitution; and that little  attention needed to be paid to the debates and votes at the
constitutional convention because it was difficult to glean a consensus from them; that Congress&#8217;s power to
borrow money included the power to issue obligations in any appropriate form, including hand-to-hand
currency; and that the authority to  issue  legal tender notes accompanied the right of coinage.</p>
<p>(see citet[p.~366-67]{Dewey1912})}</p>
<p>As we will see,  by 1884, outcomes of decisions of President Ulysses S. Grant and the post-Civil War Republican
Congresses had removed the stigma that Madison
and his colleagues had cast against Federal legal tender paper money.</p>

<p>The youthful financier&#8217;s first objective was to bolster the national credit. Without public
confidence in the government, Hamilton could not secure the funds with which to float his risky
schemes. He therefore boldly urged Congress to &#8220;fund&#8221;  the entire national debt at par and to
assume completely the debts incurred by the states during the recent war.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funding at par&#8221; meant that the federal government would pay off its debts at face value, plus
accumulated interest&#8211;a then-enormous total of more than $54 million.</p>
