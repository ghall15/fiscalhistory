\frametitle{Questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item To what extent has the U.S. economy grown its way out of debt? \bigskip

\textcolor{white}{Quite a bit.} \bigskip

\item To what extent has the Federal Government inflated its debt away? \bigskip

\textcolor{white}{Some right after WWII, but not so much in the 1970s.} \bigskip

\item How much has the Government shared inflation and interest-rate risk with its creditors? \bigskip

\textcolor{white}{Quite a bit, particularly with long-term bond holders.}

{The Law of Motion for the Debt-to-GDP Ratio}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{B_t}{Y_t} = \frac{B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} + (r_{t-1,t} - \pi_{t-1,t} - g_{t-1,t}) \frac{B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} + \frac{{\rm def}_t}{Y_t}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Whether $\frac{B}{Y}$ grows by more or less than $\frac{{\rm def}}{Y}$ depends on the relative values of $r$, $\pi$, and $g$.

\bigskip

Generalize this equation to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item allow debt to be more than one period
\item differentiate between real (TIPS) and nominal debt
\item marketable and non-marketable debt
\end{enumerate}

     **Contributions to Changes in the Debt-to-GDP Ratio


* The U.S. paid off its WWII debt with a mixture of low returns (inflation), GDP growth, and primary surpluses.

* The U.S. did not really inflate away its debt in the 1970s. 

* Debt-holders received large positive real returns in the early 1980s as inflation came down. 

* Since the 1990s the real return on debt has about equaled GDP growth so the change in $B/Y$ has about equaled the primary surpluses.
