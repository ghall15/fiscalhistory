A Coherent Policy?
------------------
.. epigraph::

     It is, in the secretary's judgment, not only difficult but impossible to apply fixed
     rules to a condition of affairs constantly changing, or to meet contingencies which
     no human reason can foresee by a steady application of general laws, especially
     in a government and with a people where public opinion is the controlling element,
     and that opinion is not under the direction of those who may happen to
     administer public affairs.

     -- Secretary of Treasury Fessenden, Dec. 1864.

    **Federal Receipts by Source**


The 5-20 loans
==============

* Beginning in February 1862, Congress authorized 7 of these loans

    * 20 year bonds

    * callable after 5 years

    * 6 percent coupon rate

* Could be purchased with legal tender notes

* Coupons paid in coin.  Congress failed to state whether the principal would be paid in coin or lawful money.

* First U.S. Treasury bonds ever called, and there were partial calls, based on the serial number

* Wanting to raise large amounts, why would the Union sell a bond that involves simultaneously {\em purchasing} a call option?

The War Ends
------------

* November 8, 1864 President Lincoln re-elected.

* April 9,  1865 General Lee surrenders to General Grant at the Appomattox Court House

* April 14, 1865 President Lincoln is assassinated, Andrew Johnson becomes president.


Post War Fiscal Situation
-------------------------

* Debt: about 35\% of GDP

* Tax revenue: 4 to 5\% of GDP

* Expenditures: 4 to 5\% of GDP

     * interest payments on the debt

     * promised pension payments

* In 2012: debt 72.5\% of GDP, revenue 15.8\% of GDP

Post War Political Situation
----------------------------

* Andrew Johnson is president

     * Democrat from Tennessee

     * had stayed loyal to the Union

     * picked to be Lincoln's running mate to be part of the "National Unity" ticket

* Congress is controlled by the "Radical Republicans"

     * there is no Southern representation in Congress

     * but that is going to change ...

A Resurgent South?
------------------

* Not admitted back into the Union yet, but ...

* The 13th Amendment removed the 3/5 rule from Constitution

    *  increase Southern representation

* Southerners want

    * assumption of Confederate debt

    * repudiation of Northern debt

    * compensation for loss of slaves

14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
---------------------------------------

* proposed: June 13, 1866

* ratified: July 9, 1868


.. epigraph::

    Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of
    pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United
    States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United
    States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal
    and void.

Post War
--------

* 14th Amendment does not resolve the 5-20 question

* In 1868 the 5-20s comprise 70\% of the interest-bearing debt and gold is trading at 40\% premium to the greenback.

* What was the Legacy of 1790 (i.e. WWHD?)

     * Lower the interest rate through discrimination and repudiation?

     * Honor the implicit and explicit promises of the past?

* What was the Legacy of 1815?

Payment of Principal in Coin or Lawful Money?
---------------------------------------------

.. epigraph::

     Various plans have been proposed for the payment of the public debt. However they may have varied
     as to the time and mode in which it should be redeemed. There seems to be a general concurrence as
     to the propriety and justness of a reduction in the present rate of interest.
     $\ldots$
     The **lessons of the past** admonish the lender that it is not well to be over-anxious
     in exacting from the borrower rigid compliance with the letter of the bond.

     -- President Andrew Johnson, 1868 State of the Union Address

Lessons of the Past?
--------------------

* What was the legacy of Alexander Hamilton and Refunding of 1790?

     * Partial repudiator who could be used by Andrew Johnson as a model?

     * A debt redeemer who could be used by Ulysses S. Grant as a model?

* What is the legacy of the War of 1812?

* What is the legacy of the state debt crisis?

The Election of 1868
--------------------

* Republicans:  Ulysses S. Grant

* Democrats: Horatio Seymour

Planks of 1868 Democratic Party Platform
----------------------------------------


3.  ... the obligations of
    the government do not expressly state upon their face, or the law under which they were issued
    does not provide, that they shall be paid in coin, they ought, in right and in justice, to be paid in
    the lawful money of the United States.

4.  Equal taxation of every species of property, according to its real value, including
    government bonds and other public securities.


5.  One currency for the government and the people, the laborer and the office-holder, the
    pensioner and the soldier, the producer and the bond-holder.

Plank of 1868 Republican Party Platform
---------------------------------------


3.  We denounce all forms of repudiation as a national crime; and national honor requires the
    payment of the public indebtedness in the utmost good faith to all creditors at home and abroad,
    not only according to the letter, but the spirit of the laws under which it was contracted.

Grant Resolves the Uncertainty
-------------------------------

.. epigraph::

     A great debt has been contracted in securing to us and our posterity the Union.
     The payment of this, principal and interest, as well as the return to a specie basis
     as soon as it can be accomplished without material detriment to the debtor class
     or to the country at large, must be provided for. To protect the national honor,
     every dollar of Government indebtedness should be paid in gold, unless otherwise
     expressly stipulated in the contract. Let it be understood that no repudiator of
     one farthing of our public debt will be trusted in public place, and it will go far
     toward strengthening a credit which ought to be the best in the world, and will
     ultimately enable us to replace the debt with bonds bearing less interest than we
     now pay.

     -- U. S. Grant, First Inaugural Address, March 1869

An Act to Strengthen the Public Credit
--------------------------------------

Passed on March 18, 1869

.. epigraph::

      the faith of the United States is solemnly pledged to the payment in coin or its equivalent of all the obligations of the
      United States not bearing interest, known as United States notes, and of all the interest-bearing obligations of the United
      States, except in cases where the law authorizing the issue of any such obligation has expressly provided that the same may be
      paid in lawful money


Grant sets the stage to redeem *all* the debt at par
----------------------------------------------------

* Committing the federal government to repay the 5-20s in gold resulted in large real returns to bondholders. From 1866 to 1875:

    *  the average government creditor received 10.2\% per year.

    * 5-20s owners received 11.7\% per year.

* The high returns delivered to federal bondholders did not come at the expense of holders of paper money.

    * June of 1868, it took 140 greenbacks to buy \$100 gold dollars, but

    * "Deflation is assumption"

* By the end of 1878, the two currencies traded at par.
