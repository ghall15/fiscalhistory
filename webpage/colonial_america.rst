Colonial America: 1750-1774
===========================

In the Government Budget Constraint lecture, we mentioned that in the U.S. today,
most residents fall under the jurisdiction of three governments: federal, state, and local.

In 1750 residents of the thirteen colonies on the Eastern seaboard of North America were government 
at two levels: 1) the King and Parliment in London and 2) the local colonial government.

Over the next 25 years the question of which of these two levels of government had the right to decide 
how the colonists should be taxed would escalate into war and revolution.
