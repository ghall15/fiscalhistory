The Government Budget Constraint
*********************************

Your Credit Card Bill
=====================

If you have a credit card, you get a bill each month.

Your balance this month is

.. math::
        \mbox{Balance this month}  &=&  \mbox{Balance last month} \\
        && \; + \; \mbox{ Finance Charge} \\
        && \; + \; \mbox{ New Purchases} \\
        && \; - \; \mbox{ Payments}
        :label: credit_card_lom

Let's re-write this as

.. math::
        B_t  =  B_{t-1} + r B_{t-1} + G_t - T_t

where we let 

* :math:`B` denote the balance, 

* :math:`r` denote the monthly interest rate (so :math:`rB` is the finance charge), 

* :math:`G` be new purchases, and 

* :math:`T` be payments.

Stock Variables and Flow Variables
==================================


*Stock variables* are measured at a point in time.

*Flow variables* are measured over a period of time.

So for your credit card

* :math:`B` is a stock variable, and  

* :math:`r B`,  :math:`G`, and :math:`T` are flow variables.


The Government Budget Constraint
================================

A sovereign government faces a budget constraint that
must hold at each period, :math:`t`:

.. math::
        B_{t} =  B_{t-1} + r B_{t-1} + G_t + TR_t - T_t

where

.. math::
   G_t  &=& \mbox{government spending during period } t \\
   TR_t &=& \mbox{transfer payments (e.g. social security) during period } t \\
   T_t &=& \mbox{taxes collected during period } t \\
   B_{t}  &=& \mbox{this period's } t \mbox{ government debt} \\
   r  &=& \mbox{real interest rate}

Many macro textbooks write it this way

.. math::
     B_{t} =  B_{t-1} + INT_t + G_t + TR_t - T_t

Fiscal Data: Federal Government
===============================

* Prior to 1790

  * constructed accounts from various reports

* 1790-present

   * U.S. Treasury (1790-1940)

   * Office of Management and Budget (1934-present)

* 1929-present

   * National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)

NIPA vs Treasury/OMB
====================

* NIPA

  * calendar year/quarter, 1929-present

  * consistent accounting with state/local as well as GDP

  * main spending categories

     * Government consumption, :math:`G_t`

     * Transfer payments, :math:`TR_t`

     * Net interest payments, :math:`INT_t`

* Treasury/OMB

  * fiscal year

  * spending divided by function

      * pre-1940: war, navy, pensions, indians, interest, ...

      * 1934-present: national defense, human resources, physical resources, net interest, ...

Comparison Between Federal and State \& Local
=============================================

* Combined U.S. federal, state, and local government together.

   * spending well over 1/3 of GDP.

*  Current composition of the federal government budget is quite different from state and local budgets.

   * One often hears

     *The federal government is a gigantic insurance company 
     with a side business in defense.*

* State and local governments more directly involved in government purchases

Revenue Side
============

NIPA: Six principal categories

#. Personal taxes:

  * Personal income taxes

2. Taxes on production and imports

  * sales taxes

  * property taxes
   
  * customs
 
3. Taxes on corporate income

4. Contributions for Social Insurance

  * Social Security

5. Transfers

6. Other

  * income on assets and government enterprises

Revenue: Federal vs. State/Local
================================

* Federal government

  * Income taxes

  * Contributions for social insurance

* State/Local

  * property and sales taxes

  * transfers from the federal government

* Compositional changes for federal government over time

  * customs to internal revenue (income taxes)

Deficits and Surpluses
======================

The budget deficit that gets reported in the newspaper is

.. math::
  G_t + TR_t + INT_t - T_t

When this number is positive there is a budget deficit.

When this number is negative there is a budget surplus.

Change in the debt is equal to the deficit

.. math::
  B_{t} - B_{t-1}  =  INT_t + G_t + TR_t - T_t

The *net-of-interest deficit* or *primary deficit* is 

.. math::
  G_t + TR_t - T_t

The total or gross deficit tells the amount the government must borrow to
cover all of its expenditures.

The primary deficit ignores interest payments

The Printing Press
======================

Since the signing of the U.S. Constitution, the Federal government can raise revenue by issuing money.

   State and local governments can not.

For the Federal government

.. math::
  B_{t}  =  B_{t-1} + r B_{t-1} + G_t + TR_t - T_t  - \frac{M_t - M_{t-1}}{P_t}

where

..math::
    M_{t}-M_{t-1} &=& \mbox{New money printed this period.} \\
    P_t           &=& \mbox{Price level this period ($t$)} \\
    & & \mbox{i.e. the relative price of money in terms of goods}

This additional term is called {\em seignorage} or the inflation tax.

So the government budget constraint becomes

..math::
    B_{t}  &=&  B_{t-1} + r B_{t-1} + G_t + TR_t - T_t  - \frac{M_t - M_{t-1}}{P_t}

Write it as

..math::
B_{t}  -  B_{t-1} + \frac{M_t - M_{t-1}}{P_t}  =  r B_{t-1} + G_t + TR_t - T_t

Decisions about :math:`G_t`, :math:`TR_t` and :math:`T_t` are called *fiscal policy*

Decision about :math:`B_t` and :math`M_t` are called *monetary policy*.

Debt-to-GDP Ratio
=================

Suppose the credit card balance is :math:`\$20,000`.  Is this a big balance?

* Well it depends

  * If your annual income is :math:`\$15,000`, then yes.

  * If your annual income is :math:`\$1,500,000`, then no.

* It also depends on how fast your income is growing.

So we might be interested in the ratio of debt-to-income.  Let's call income :math:`Y`, and the ratio of
debt-to-income :math:`\frac{B}{Y}`.

A Digression on the U.S. Debt
=============================

See the `U.S. Treasury Monthly Statement of the Public Debt
<http://www.savingsbonds.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/mspd.htm>`_.

* Marketable Debt

  * Treasury bills, notes, and bonds

  * can be bought and sold on secondary markets

* Non-marketable Debt

  * no secondary market -- saving bonds,  state and local governments

* Held by the Public

  * you, me, China

* Held inside the government

  * Social Security Trust Fund

Ignore seignorage for now, set :math:`TR = 0`.

..math::
   B_{t}  &=&  B_{t-1} + r B_{t-1} + G_t - T_t \\
   &=&  (1+r) B_{t-1} + G_t - T_t

Divide both sides of the equation by current income :math::`Y_t`

..math::
    \frac{B_{t}}{Y_t}  &=&  (1+r) \frac{B_{t-1}}{Y_t} + \frac{G_t - T_t}{Y_t} \\
    &=&  (1+r) \frac{B_{t-1}}{Y_t}\frac{Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} + \frac{G_t - T_t}{Y_t} \\
    &=&  (1+r) \frac{B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}\frac{Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t}} + \frac{G_t - T_t}{Y_t}

Let :math:`g` denote the percentage change in :math:`Y`

..math::
   g = \frac{Y_t}{Y_{t-1}} - 1

so
..math::
   \frac{Y_{t-1}}{Y_t} = \frac{1}{1+g}

So we can write
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{B_{t}}{Y_t} &=&  \frac{(1+r)}{(1+g)} \frac{B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} + \frac{G_t - T_t}{Y_t} \\
                  &\approx&  (1+r-g) \frac{B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} + \frac{G_t - T_t}{Y_t} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\item To keep the math simple, assume $G$ and $T$ are constant over time.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sustainable Fiscal Policy}

\begin{itemize}

\item Most countries have positive debt-to-GDP ratios.

\item In the short-term, it is often no big deal if this ratio rises.

\item But can debt-to-GDP ratios rise forever?
\begin{itemize}
\item debt crisis
\item currency crisis
\item hyperinflation
\end{itemize}

\item In other words, which paths of $B/Y$ are stable? which are explosive?

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{B_{t}}{Y_t} =  (1+r-g) \frac{B_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} + \frac{G - T}{Y_t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Consider two cases
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g>r$
\item $g \le r$
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

\item If $g > r$, the debt-to-GDP ratio will not blow up.
So a government can sustain persistent deficits as long as growth
in output is greater than the real interest rate.

\medskip

\item In the U.S. $r = 0.016$  and $g = 0.033$.

\medskip

\item Don't necessarily need a balanced budget.
