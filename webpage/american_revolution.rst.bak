***********************
The American Revolution
***********************

*A revolution, a war, the dissolution of government, the creating of it anew, cruelty, rapine, 
and devastation in the midst of our very bowels.  These sir are circumstances by no means 
favorable to finance.*

Robert Morris in a letter to Ben Franklin, November 27, 1781.

How does one finance a revolution?
==================================

* Continental Congress first met in 1774
   - Not clear whether the goal was independence or to change Britain's policies

* Consider the government budget constraint

.. math::
     B_{t}  =  (1+r)B_{t-1} + G_t - T_t  - \frac{M_t - M_{t-1}}{P_t}

* The Congress's options were
  - tax
  - borrow
  - print money

* Problems become obvious immediately 

    1. Who is going to pay taxes?
          - revolution based on "taxation without representation"
          - already paying taxes to Britain

    2. Who is going to lend the Congress resources?
          - How many periods will the Congress going to be in existence?

          .. math::
               B_{t}  =   \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{j}(T_{t+j} -G_{t+j})

    3. Who is going to accept Congress's money as payment for goods and services?

* Congress tried all three with mixed success

     1.  taxes
         - requisitions from the states
         - sell public goods
         - gifts
         - privateering

     2. loans
         - domestic -- loan office certificates, certificates of indebtedness
         - foreign -- France, Holland, Spain

     3. seignorage
         - Continental dollars (i.e bills of credit)

Attempts at "Taxation"
----------------------

* lotteries

* requisitions from the states

* sell public goods

* gifts

* privateering

    *What is missing from this list?*

Bills of Credit
---------------

* Continental Dollars

.. image:: _static/images/Continental.jpg
    :scale: 70%
    :align: center

* The first authorization of *bills of credit* was made in Philadelphia in May 1775.

* The colonists had prior experience with bills of credit

   - A colony would issue perhaps \$20,000 bills of credit, and then

   - over the next four years, require \$5,000 in taxes payable in these bills.

* Prior to the war, many colonies had issued bills of credit with success

   - developed a good reputation

* The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has a nice `gallery of Colonial and Revolutionary money`_. 

.. _gallery of Colonial and Revolutionary money: http://www.frbsf.org/currency/independence/show.html

* In 1775, what is a dollar?

  - Spanish milled dollar

.. image:: _static/images/spanish_milled_dollar.jpg
    :scale: 140%
    :align: center

* Shortage of media of exchange

   - Largely rural society

        * illiquid assets: land, animals, tools

        * agricultural goods often poor assets

* No banks

* No ability to mine gold and silver in the colonies

* If the colonies wanted gold or silver coins, then they needed to run a current account surplus

    - could only trade with Britain, who set the rules

    - not enough trade, not large enough surpluses to import the quantity of money needed

* Colonial governments issued bills of credit

    - for the most part worked

Definitions: Fiat vs. Commodity Money
-------------------------------------

* fiat money

    - fiat -- Latin for *let it be done*

    - money with no intrinsic value

* commodity money

    - money backed by something of intrinsic value

    - for example gold certificates

* specie

    - money in gold or silver

    - hard money

Why did anyone accept bills of credit?
--------------------------------------

* What is money?

   1. medium of exchange

   2. store of value

   3. unit of account

* Shortage of medium of exchange

* Thought experiment:  disintegrating money ...

* Continental government requested that the states accept bills of credit for payment of taxes.

   - each colony given a quota

   - these bills of credit would then be returned to the Continental government to be burned.

   - riding on the good reputations of the colonies

* Congress had harsh words for those who did not accept these bills

      *That if any person shall hereafter be so 
      lost to all virtue and regard for his country to refuse ..., 
      such person shall be deemed an enemy of his country*

* Congress also recommended to states that the state legislatures pass laws making these bills of credit *legal tender*.

* The first of eleven emissions occurred on June 22, 1775.

* The bills were apportioned across the colonies on the basis of population.

* By November 1779 the total outstanding was \$199,990,000.

   - Gross emission were \$241,550,000, but some were redeemed or exchanged.

* Colonies had trouble fulfilling their quotas

   - revolution wrecks an economy

   - tax collection still rudimentary

.. figure:: _static/figures/cont_dollar_out_1781.png
    :scale: 60%
    :align: center

    **Continental Dollar: Quantity Outstanding**

* Too Many Pieces of Paper chasing too few goods

* Recall the quantity theory of money

.. math::
    \mbox{Money $\times$ Velocity} & = & \mbox{Price  $\times$  Output}  \\
    M  \times  V                  & = &  P \times Y   

* If :math:`Y` and :math:`V` are constant, then :math:`P` moves with :math:`M`.

* Value of Continental dollar fell.

   - blame profiteers, monopolists ...

* Continental dollars were used to pay state taxes during in 1780s

   - Congress accepted 40 Continental dollars in place of 1 Spanish dollar in remittances.

* The face value of the Continental dollars outstanding in 1789: \$80,527,630.

Loan Office Certificates
------------------------

* On October 3, 1776 Congress voted to borrow \$5 million Continental dollars at a 4\% interest rate.

* Loan offices were opened in each state and authorized to receive subscriptions.

* At a 4\% interest rate, few loan certificates were sold and the loan failed.

* On January 14 and February 22, 1777 Congress authorized \$15 million in new loans.

* On February 26, the interest rate was raised to 6\%. Over the next three years \$12 million of these loan certificates were sold.

* There were two types of these certificates

     1. ones that promised to pay species
     2. ones that repaid in Continental currency.

* Minimum denomination was \$300.  These certificates were not intended to circulate as currency,

    **Loan Office Certificate**

Why Would Someone Loan Money to the Revolutionaries?
----------------------------------------------------

* Lack of liquid stores of value

* Congress voted that for any loan office certificate purchased prior to March 1, 1778, the government would

   - accept bills of credit at face value to purchase loan office certificates
   - pay interest in specie (ie. Spanish dollars)

* At that time, Continental dollars traded 1.25 and 5 C.D. to Spanish dollar

   - 7.5 to 30 percent return

What the difference between bonds and money?
--------------------------------------------

* Re-write the government budget constraint as

.. math::
       B_{t} + \frac{M_t}{P_t} =  B_{t-1} + r B_{t-1} + G_t + TR_t - T_t  - \frac{M_{t-1}}{P_t}
           
* bonds pay interest, money does not

* If bonds pay interest, and money does not why doesn't every use bonds to carry out trade?

      - There were essentially three types of currency circulating simultaneously.
      - Reduced demand for Continental dollars, exacerbating their depreciation.

* Pennsylvania Packet, January 20, 1780

*I only contend for the immediate dissolution of the loan office; for
why should the community be burdened with an addition of taxes, merely
to pay an interest to moneyed men, for lending paper to government;
when the very paper could be as well made without any other expense
than striking it; and the larger these bills the better: if a thousand
dollars each, it might help to retard the circulation and lessen the
charge of printing and signing.  It is to be observed, that the whole
of my reasoning on this subject, turns upon the assertion, that loan
office certificates are money to all intents and purposes, and operate
in proportion to their quantity equal to alike sum of Continental
bills -- if I am wrong my conclusions fall to the ground.*

Certificates of Indebtedness
----------------------------

* Congress authorized quartermasters, commissaries, and other officers to issue certificates of indebtedness for supplies taken for the army.

* Often a form of impressment or expropriation.

* In February 1782, Robert Morris nominated a commissioner for each state to review all civilian claims and exchange old certificates and such for *final settlement certificates*.

* These final settlement certificates promised a 6 per cent interest rate.

Final Settlement Certificates
-----------------------------

* A typical final settlement certificate:

* show picture of final settlement certificate here

Interest in Arrears
-------------------

* After March 1, 1782 the Congress of the Confederation had no resources to pay interest or principal on loan office certificates or final settlement certificates.

Foreign Loans
-------------

* Congress also borrowed extensively from France, Holland, and Spain.

   - financed military supplies from these countries
   - Some loans represent subsidies

* France

   - Borrowing began in 1777.
   - First loans payable in tobacco; stopped due to British navy
   - Total borrowing from France exceeded \$6.5 million

* Spain

   - Single loan from Spain for \$174,011 issued though out 1781-1782
   - Secret loan
   - American negotiators tried to get Florida in the deal.

* Holland

Debts Due to Foreign Officers
-----------------------------

* Needed to compensate  foreign officers who fought in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.

* Many were destitute and unable to go home.

* Initially paid certificated of indebtedness bearing an interest of 6 per cent.

   - value quickly depreciated

* On January 22, 1784 the Continental Congress authorized these certificates to be called in and new certificates to be issued.  These new certificates paid a 6 per cent coupon, payable in gold annually at a Paris bank.


* Foreign officers probably did better than their American counterparts.

    **Face Value Foreign Loans Outstanding**

Fiscal Accounting: Two Approaches
=================================

1. Stock Approach

   * aggregate the debt bond-by-bond, period-by-period
   * precise data on foreign bonds
   * incomplete data on the domestic debt, almost no data on state debts

2. Flow Approach

   * impute the debt from the stream of expenditures and revenue
   * know debt in 1775 = 0 and 1792 = \$80 million
   * no complete set of accounts for the 1776 to 1789 period

Continental Government at the End of the War
============================================

* On one hand

     * were responsible for a hyperinflation
     * owed \$40 million in debts (and this amount will continue to grow)
     * had not made an interest payment since 1782

* On the other hand

     * just won their independence
     * now controlled 1/3 of a continent

A Big Caveat
------------

* This lecture focused on Continental finance

       * only one part of the story

* Clearly a lot going on at the colony (i.e. state) level

      * I don't know the details
      * I would like to learn these details
